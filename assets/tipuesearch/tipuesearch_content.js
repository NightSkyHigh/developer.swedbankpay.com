Operations The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the href and method as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its rel value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the rel and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation. Operation Description update-payment-abort aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. redirect-authorization Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the card authorization UI. view-authorization Contains the JavaScript href that is used to embed the card authorization UI directly on the webshop/merchant site create-capture Creates a capture transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer. create-cancellation Creates a cancellation transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment. Abort: It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no successful transactions. See the abort description. An invoice authorization must be followed by a capture or cancel request. For reversals, you will need to implement the reversal request. If CallbackURL is set: Whenever changes to the payment occur a Callback request will be posted to the callbackUrl, which was generated when the payment was created. Abort To abort a payment, perform the update-payment-abort operation that is returned in the payment request.

Which these operations are and how they are executed is described below.

One-phase payments like Swish are settled directly without the option to capture or cancel. For a full list of the available operations, see the techincal reference. Operation Description create-paymentorder-capture The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. create-paymentorder-cancel Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount. create-paymentorder-reversal Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed.

Abort: It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no successful transactions. See the Abort description here. If the payment shown above is done as a two phase (Authorization), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests. For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request. If CallbackURL is set: Whenever changes to the payment occur a Callback request will be posted to the callbackUrl, which was generated when the payment was created.

    "text": "Step 5: Capture the funds Capture can only be done on a payment with a successful authorized transaction, and if the authorization was not done on a one-phase payment instrument. Examples of one-phase payment instruments are Swish and Vipps, while payment instruments such as Credit Card are two-phase payments, requiring a Capture to be performed. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. This is done by requesting the order information from the server, to get the request link to perform the capture. With this, you can request the capture with the sum to capture, and get back the status. sequenceDiagram participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay rect rgba(81,43,43,0.1) activate Merchant note left of Payer: Capture Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: rel:create-paymentorder-capture deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;- Merchant: Capture status note right of Merchant: Capture here only if the purchased&lt;br/&gt;goods don't require shipping.&lt;br/&gt;If shipping is required, perform capture&lt;br/&gt;after the goods have shipped.&lt;br&gt;Should only be used for &lt;br&gt;PaymentInstruments that support &lt;br&gt;Authorizations. end To capture the authorized payment, we need to perform create-paymentorder-capture against the accompanying href returned in the operations list.

The redirect-consumer-identification method redirects the user to Swedbank’s own site to handle the checkin and is used in other implementations. redirect-consumer-identification should only be used in test enviroments.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Card Payments – Direct",
    "text": "warning Section under review This section of the Developer Portal is under review and may be incomplete or contain minor errors. The Direct Card Payment scenario is used by customers that are compliant with PCI-DSS regulations, and is a way to implement Card Payments without using a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. info Note on 3-D Secure Authentication Although there is no need to redirect to a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page in the Direct Card Payment scenario, consumers will need to be redirected to a 3-D Secure page hosted by the issuing bank if the bank requires it. Whether 3-D Secure authentication is required for every payment is up to each issuing bank and out of Swedbank Pay’s control. error PCI-DSS Complicance The direct integration option requires you to collect the card data on your website, which means it must be PCI-DSS Compliant. Payment flow Below is a quick stepwise summary of how the Direct Card Payment scenario works. The payer places an order and you make a Purchase request towards Swedbank Pay with the gathered payment information. The action taken next is the direct-authorization operation that is returned in the first request. You POST the payer’s card data to the URL in the direct-authorization operation. If the issuer requires 3-D Secure authentication, you will then receive an operation called redirect-authentication. You must redirect the payer to this URL to let them authenticate against the issuer’s 3-D Secure page. When the 3-D Secure flow is completed, the payer will be redirected back to the URL provided in completeUrl or cancelUrl, depending on the actions performed by the payer. If the issuer does not require 3-D Secure authentication, the payment will already be Completed after performing the direct-authorization request. Note that Completed just indicates that the payment is in a final state; the financial transaction could be either OK or failed. Finally you make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment created in the first step, which will return the result of the authorization. Step 1: Create a Purchase A Purchase payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer. It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction. An example of an abbreviated POST request is provided below. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below.

Not usable for programmatic identification of the payment, for that id should be used instead. └➔ created string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was created. └➔ updated string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was updated. └➔ state string Ready, Pending, Failed or Aborted. Indicates the state of the payment, not the state of any transactions performed on the payment. To find the state of the payment’s transactions (such as a successful authorization), see the transactions resource or the different specialized type-specific resources such as authorizations or sales. └➔ prices object The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment. └─➔ id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the prices resource . Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ amount integer The amount (including VAT, if any) to charge the payer, entered in the lowest monetary unit of the selected currency.

If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. report_problem Step 2 is to create an authorization transaction. Implement only Step 2a if 3-D Secure authentication is enabled. Note that if the issuer does not require 3-D Secure authentication, implement only Step 2b. You will see that the requests are the same for both steps. The difference is in the operations, where Step 2a has the redirect-authentication operation in its response. This is needed for the payer to be redirected to complete the 3-D Secure authentication. Step 2a: Create authorization without 3-D Secure authentication The direct-authorization operation creates an authorization transaction directly.

Note that Completed does not indicate a successful payment, only that it has reached a final (complete) state. A GET request needs to be performed on the payment to inspect it further. Step 2b: Create authorization with 3-D Secure authentication If the issuer requires 3-D Secure authentication, the response from the authorization request will contain a redirect-authentication operation and the state of the transaction will be AwaitingActivity. This means that the payer will have to be redirected to the issuer to complete the 3-D Secure authentication. See the request and response examples below.

    "text": "report_problem Disclaimer Direct Invoice is about to be phased out. This section is only for merchants that currently have a contract with this integration. Direct is a payment service where Swedbank Pay helps improve cashflow by purchasing merchant invoices. Swedbank Pay receives invoice data, which is used to produce and distribute invoices to the consumer/end-user Invoice Direct implementation flow Collect all purchase information and send it in a POST request to Swedbank Pay. Make sure to include personal information (SSN and postal code). Make a new POST request towards Swedbank Pay to retrieve the name and address of the customer to create a purchase. Create a POSTrequest to retrieve the transaction status. Send a GET request with the paymentID to get the authorization result. Make a Capture by creating a POST request. An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an Authorize transaction, that is followed by a Capture or Cancel request. The Capture , Cancel, Reversal opions are described in other features. info Note that the invoice will not be created/distributed before you have made a capture request. By making a Capture, Swedbank Pay will generate the invoice to the consumer and the order is ready for shipping. link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. The 3 most important steps in the Invoice Direct flow are shown below. Step 1: Create a Purchase Our payment example below uses the FinancingConsumer value.

Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. Step 1: Create a Purchase A Purchase payment is created by performing the following request.

    "title": "Good Commit Practice",
    "text": "The following document is a fork of OpenStack’s Git Commit Good Practice, rewritten to suit Swedbank Pay needs. It is based on experience doing code development, bug troubleshooting and code review across a number of projects using Git. Examination of other open source projects suggested they all follow a fairly common practice. It is motivated by a desire to improve the quality of the Git history in any repository. Quality is a hard term to define in computing; one person’s “Thing of Beauty” is another’s “Evil Hack”. We can, however, come up with some general guidelines for what to do, or conversely what not to do, when publishing Git commits for merge with a project. This topic can be split into two areas of concern: The structured set/split of the code changes The information provided in the commit message Executive Summary The points and examples that will be raised in this document ought to clearly demonstrate the value in splitting up changes into a sequence of individual commits, and the importance in writing good commit messages to go along with them. If these guidelines were widely applied it would result in a significant improvement in the quality of the Git history. Both a carrot and a stick will be required to effect changes. This document intends to be the carrot by alerting people to the benefits, while for anyone doing code reviews, it can act as the stick. In other words, when reviewing a change, do not simply look at the correctness of the code. Review the commit message itself and request improvements to its content. Look out for commits which are mixing multiple logical changes and require the submitter to split them into separate commits. Ensure whitespace changes are not mixed in with functional changes. Ensure no-op code refactoring is done separately from functional changes. And so on. Software source code is “read mostly, write occassionally” and thus the most important criteria is to improve the long term maintainability by the large pool of developers in the community, and not to sacrifice too much for the sake of the single author who may never touch the code again. And now the long detailed guidelines and examples of good and bad practice. Structural split of changes The cardinal rule for creating good commits is to ensure there is only one “logical change” per commit. There are many reasons why this is an important rule: The smaller the amount of code being changed, the quicker and easier it is to review and identify potential flaws. If a change is found to be flawed later, it may be necessary to revert the broken commit. This is much easier to do if there are not other unrelated code changes entangled with the original commit. When troubleshooting problems using Git’s bisect capability, small well defined changes will aid in isolating exactly where the code problem was introduced. When browsing history using Git annotate/blame, small well defined changes also aid in isolating exactly where &amp; why a piece of code came from. Things to avoid when creating commits With that in mind, there are some commonly encountered examples of bad things to avoid: Mixing formatting changes with functional code changes The formatting (code style, whitespace, etc.) changes will obscure the important functional changes, making it harder for a reviewer to correctly determine whether the change is correct. Solution: Create 2 commits, one with the formatting changes and one with the functional changes. Typically the formatting change would be done first, but that need not be a hard rule. Mixing two unrelated functional changes Again the reviewer will find it harder to identify flaws if two unrelated changes are mixed together. If it becomes necessary to later revert a broken commit, the two unrelated changes will need to be untangled, with further risk of bug creation. Sending large new features in a single giant commit It may well be the case that the code for a new feature is only useful when all of it is present. This does not, however, imply that the entire feature should be provided in a single commit. To group related code changes that for the reasons explained here are split up into several separate commits, intuitively named branches should be used instead. New features often entail refactoring existing code. It is highly desirable that any refactoring is done in commits which are separate from those implementing the new feature. This helps reviewers and test suites validate that the refactoring has no unintentional functional changes. Even the newly written code can often be split up into multiple pieces that can be independently reviewed. For example, changes which add new internal APIs/classes, can be in self-contained commits. Again this leads to easier code review. It also allows other developers to cherry-pick small parts of the work, if the entire new feature is not immediately ready for merge. Addition of new public HTTP APIs or RPC interfaces should be done in commits separate from the actual internal implementation. This will encourage the author &amp; reviewers to think about the generic API/RPC design, and not simply pick a design that is easier for their currently chosen internal implementation. If patch impacts a public HTTP, use the APIImpact flag (see including external references). The basic rule to follow is: If a code change can be split into a sequence of patches/commits, then it should be split. Less is not more. More is more. Examples of bad practice Now for some illustrations from Nova history. NB, although commit hashes are quoted for reference, author names are removed, since no single person needs to be blamed/picked on. Almost everybody is guilty of violating these good practice rules at some time or another. In addition the people who reviewed and approved these commits are just as guilty as the person who wrote/submitted them. Example 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 commit ae878fc8b9761d099a4145617e4a48cbeb390623 Author: [removed] Date: Fri Jun 1 01:44:02 2012 +0000 Refactor libvirt create calls * minimizes duplicated code for create * makes wait_for_destroy happen on shutdown instead of undefine * allows for destruction of an instance while leaving the domain * uses reset for hard reboot instead of create/destroy * makes resume_host_state use new methods instead of hard_reboot * makes rescue/unrescue not use hard reboot to recreate domain Change-Id: I2072f93ad6c889d534b04009671147af653048e7 There are at least two independent changes made in this commit. The switch to use the new reset API for the hard_reboot method. The adjustment to internal driver methods to not use hard_reboot. What is the problem with this? First there is no compelling reason why these changes needed to be made at the same time. A first commit could have included the changes to stop calling hard_reboot in various places. A second commit could have re-written the hard_reboot impl. Second, as the switch to using the libvirt ##reset## method was buried in the large code refactoring, reviewers missed the fact that this was introducing a dependency on a newer libvirt API version. This commit was identified as the culprit reasonably quickly, but a trivial revert is not possible, due to the wide variety of unrelated changes included.

Implements LVM disks support for libvirt driver. VM disks will be stored on LVM volumes in volume group specified by `libvirt_images_volume_group` option. Another option `libvirt_local_images_type` specify which storage type will be used. Supported values are `raw`, `lvm`, `qcow2`, `default`. If `libvirt_local_images_type` = `default`, usual logic with `use_cow_images` flag is used. Boolean option `libvirt_sparse_logical_volumes` controls which type of logical volumes will be created (sparsed with virtualsize or usual logical volumes with full space allocation). Default value for this option is `False`. Commit introduce three classes: `Raw`, `Qcow2` and `Lvm`. They contain image creation logic, that was stored in `LibvirtConnection._cache_image` and `libvirt_info` methods, that produce right `LibvirtGuestConfigDisk` configurations for libvirt. `Backend` class choose which image type to use. Change-Id: I0d01cb7d2fd67de2565b8d45d34f7846ad4112c2 This is introducing one major new feature, so on the surface it seems reasonable to use a single commit, but looking at the patch, it clearly has entangled a significant amount of code refactoring with the new LVM feature code. This makes it hard to identify likely regressions in support for QCow2/Raw images. This should have been split into at least four separate commits: Replace the use_cow_images config FLAG with the new FLAG libvirt_local_images_type, with back-compat code for support of legacy use_cow_images FLAG 2. Creation of internal “Image” class and subclasses for Raw &amp; QCow2 image type impls. Refactor libvirt driver to replace raw/qcow2 image management code, with calls to the new Image class APIs. Introduce the new “LVM” Image class implementation.

This sequence of commits refactored the entire RPC API layer inside nova to allow pluggable messaging implementations. With such a major change in a core piece of functionality, splitting up the work into a large sequence of commits was key to be able to do meaningful code review, and track / identify possible regressions at each step of the process. Information in commit messages As important as the content of the change, is the content of the commit message describing it. When writing a commit message there are some important things to remember: Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was When reading bug reports, after a number of back &amp; forth comments, it is often as clear as mud, what the root cause problem is. The commit message should have a clear statement as to what the original problem is. The bug is merely interesting historical background on how the problem was identified. It should be possible to review a proposed patch for correctness without needing to read the bug ticket. Do not assume the reviewer has access to external web services/site In 6 months time when someone is on a train/plane/coach/beach/pub troubleshooting a problem &amp; browsing Git history, there is no guarantee they will have access to the online bug tracker, or online blueprint documents. The great step forward with distributed SCM is that you no longer need to be “online” to have access to all information about the code repository. The commit message should be totally self-contained, to maintain that benefit. Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting What is self-evident to one person, might be clear as mud to another person. Always document what the original problem was and how it is being fixed, for any change except the most obvious typos, or whitespace only commits. Describe why a change is being made A common mistake is to just document how the code has been written, without describing why the developer chose to do it that way. By all means describe the overall code structure, particularly for large changes, but more importantly describe the intent/motivation behind the changes. Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure Often when describing a large commit message, it becomes obvious that a commit should have in fact been split into 2 or more parts. Don’t be afraid to go back and rebase the change to split it up into separate commits. Ensure sufficient information to decide whether to review When Gerrit sends out email alerts for new patch submissions there is minimal information included, principally the commit message and the list of files changes. Given the high volume of patches, it is not reasonable to expect all reviewers to examine the patches in detail. The commit message must thus contain sufficient information to alert the potential reviewers to the fact that this is a patch they need to look at. The first commit line is the most important In Git commits the first line of the commit message has special significance. It is used as email subject line, git annotate messages, gitk viewer annotations, merge commit messages and many more places where space is at a premium. As well as summarizing the change itself, it should take care to detail what part of the code is affected. eg if it affects the libvirt driver, mention ‘libvirt’ somewhere in the first line. Describe any limitations of the current code If the code being changed still has future scope for improvements, or any known limitations then mention these in the commit message. This demonstrates to the reviewer that the broader picture has been considered and what tradeoffs have been done in terms of short term goals vs. long term wishes. Do not include patch set-specific comments In other words, if you rebase your change please don’t add “Patch set 2: rebased” to your commit message. That isn’t going to be relevant once your change has merged. Please do make a note of that in Gerrit as a comment on your change, however. It helps reviewers know what changed between patch sets. This also applies to comments such as “Added unit tests”, “Fixed localization problems”, or any other such patch set to patch set changes that don’t affect the overall intent of your commit. The main rule to follow is: The commit message must contain all the information required to fully understand &amp; review the patch for correctness. Less is not more. More is more. Including external references The commit message is primarily targeted towards human interpretation, but there is always some metadata provided for machine use. For source code hosted on GitHub, a reference to an issue can be made by simply writing #&lt;issue-number&gt;. All machine targeted metadata is of secondary consequence to humans and thus it should preferably be grouped together at the end of the commit message. For simple references like GitHub issues, this is not required. Note: Although it is common practice across many open source projects using Git to include a Signed-off-by tag (generated by ‘git commit -s’), this is not required. Prior to gaining the ability to submit code, it should rather be required that all contributors sign a CLA, which serves an equivalent purpose. We encourage the use of Co-Authored-By: name name@example.com in commit messages to indicate people who worked on a particular patch. It’s a convention for recognizing multiple authors, and our projects would encourage the stats tools to observe it when collecting statistics. Summary of Git commit message structure Provide a brief description of the change in the first line. Insert a single blank line after the first line. Provide a detailed description of the change in the following lines, breaking paragraphs where needed. The first line should be limited to 50 characters and should not end with a period. Subsequent lines should be wrapped at 72 characters. vim (the default $EDITOR on most distros) can wrap automatically lines for you. In most cases you just need to copy the example vimrc file (which can be found somewhere like /usr/share/vim/vim74/vimrc_example.vim) to /.vimrc if you don’t have one already. After editing a paragraph, you can re-wrap it by pressing escape, ensuring the cursor is within the paragraph and typing gqip. Put external references at the very end of the commit message. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Switch libvirt get_cpu_info method over to use config APIs The get_cpu_info method in the libvirt driver currently uses XPath queries to extract information from the capabilities XML document. Switch this over to use the new config class LibvirtConfigCaps. Also provide a test case to validate the data being returned.

In particular Windows 7 guests will often crash with the default KVM timer policies, and old Linux guests will have very bad time drift Set the PIT such that missed ticks are injected at the normal rate, ie they are delayed Set the RTC such that missed ticks are injected at a higher rate to \"catch up\" This corresponds to the following libvirt XML &lt;clock offset='utc'&gt; &lt;timer name='pit' tickpolicy='delay'/&gt; &lt;timer name='rtc' tickpolicy='catchup'/&gt; &lt;/clock&gt; And the following KVM options -no-kvm-pit-reinjection -rtc base=utc,driftfix=slew This should provide a default configuration that works acceptably for most OS types. In the future this will likely need to be made configurable per-guest OS type.

    "text": "Vipps is the Norwegian way of paying with your mobile phone, fast and simple. Vipps is the main Norwegian payment app for mobile phones supported by the major Norwegian banks, making it one of the essential payment instruments for merchants operating in Norway. We offer it on our redirect and seamless view platforms. Purchase flow After the payment is created, the consumer pushes the payment button on Swedbank Pay’s payment page (redirect) or in the iframe (seamless view). He or she is then redirected to Vipps’ own payment page where the phone number is entered, and a push message is sent to the phone. The payment request will appear in the app and can be confirmed by the consumer. If you are using the redirect option, the consumer will be redirected back to the merchant’s site. Good To Know Payment Type Vipps is one of the instruments using two-phase payments. The authorization is done when the consumer successfully confirms in the app, and the abort, cancel, capture or reversal is done by the merchant at a later time. Read more about the different operations and the payment resource. Settlement Vipps transactions are handled, processed and settled as card transactions in our system. They are, however, tagged as Vipps transactions and have their own acquirer agreement, so the two payment instruments are settled separately. 3-D Secure As Vipps transactions are processed as card transactions, a 3-D Secure agreement is needed to complete the payment instrument setup. This information is provided to you by your acquirer when you set up your agreement with them. If you offer both Card Payments and Vipps, you will need two separate 3-D Secure agreements, one for each payment instrument. Apart from the agreement with the acquirer, no further 3-D Secure compliance is required from you as a merchant in this regard. Demoshop Vipps is unfortunately not available in our demoshop at the moment, but it will be shortly. The demoshop will use a fakeservice which enables you to test a successful purchase without using the Vipps app. Languages ​Vipps supports the following languages: English (US) en-US, Norwegian nb-NO and Swedish sv-SE.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Card Payments – Introduction",
    "text": "Card Payments is the most popular, versatile and global way to initate a transaction with a customer. Choose between our Seamless View, Redirect, or Direct integration options. branding_watermark Seamless View is our solution for a payment experience that is integrated directly on your website. The payment process will be executed in an iframe on your page. cached Redirect will take the consumer to a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page where they can perform a safe transaction. The consumer will be redirected back to your website after the completion of the payment. open_in_browser Direct integration is a way to implement card payments without using Swedbank Pay hosted payment pages. This option allow you to collect the card data on your page. That implies that the process must be PCI-DSS Compliant When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You either receive a Redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay hosted page (Redirect integration) or a JavaScript source in response (Seamless View integration). You need to redirect the payer’s browser to that specified URL, or embed the script source on your site to create a Hosted View in an iframe; so that she can enter the credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required. Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer’s browser to - or display directly in the iframe - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a GET request, containing the id of the payment generated in the first step, to receive the state of the transaction. You will redirect the payer to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the credit card information. Operations The API requests are displayed in the purchase flow. You can create a card payment with following operation options: Purchase Recur Payout Verify Unscheduled Purchase Our payment example below uses the Purchase operation. Intent Intent The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be effectuated. This determines the type of transaction used during the payment process. Authorization (two-phase): If you want the credit card to reserve the amount, you will have to specify that the intent of the Purchase is Authorization. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request later on to fulfill the transaction. AutoCapture (one-phase): If you want the credit card to be charged (without additional operations), you will have to specify that the intent of the Purchase is AutoCapture. This is normally only allowed if the consumer purchases digital products with instant delivery/shipment. Check with your acquirer before using this feature. The amount will be reserved via the authorization and the credit card will be charged automatically. You don’t need to do any more financial operations to fulfill the transaction. Languages ​Card supports the following languages: Danish da-DK, German de-DE, Estonian ee-EE, English (US) en-US, Spanish es-ES, Finnish fi-FI, French fr-FR, Lithuanian lt-LT, Latvian lv-LV, Norwegian nb-NO, Russian ru-RU and Swedish sv-SE. Purchase Flow The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of a complete purchase, and the requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay. The links will take you directly to the corresponding API description. When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API Request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: authorization page activate Payer note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay&lt;br&gt;(If Redirect scenario) Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase result activate Payer sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: authorization page activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authorization page activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay&lt;br&gt;(If Redirect scenario) SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase information activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;Payer: input creditcard information Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: submit creditcard information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process activate IssuingBank Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: redirect to merchant activate Payer note left of Payer: redirect back to merchant&lt;br&gt;(If Redirect scenario) Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase result opt Callback is set activate SwedbankPay SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Payment is updated SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: POST Payment Callback end Next: Redirect",

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Open Source Development Guidelines",
    "text": "Introduction Swedbank Pay is committed to creating a vibrant community around its open source initiative on GitHub and will alongside its partners expose the Swedbank Pay Payment APIs in high quality client modules and libraries. The development of these modules and libraries should be as transparent and accessible to the public as possible. The consequence and meaning of this will be explained in the following chapters of this guideline. Having the source code, tests, documentation, issues and such all in one place makes the projects governing the modules and libraries easier to grasp and understand for new users. GitHub is the world’s most popular developer and source code hosting platform and offers everything we need in an easy to use package. It is therefore a great choice for hosting the source code for the open source modules and all of their related resources. Principles For an open source project to become successful, it should follow a few core principles: Transparency Being transparent is one of the most important virtues of an open source project. Being able to inspect the source code, read the documentation, view potentially reported bugs and understand the development process in an accessible and easy to understand way is critical to be able to assert the quality of the project. Being transparent also makes it apparent that we don’t have anything to hide, underlining our confidence in the quality of what we publish, which of course should be top notch. Quality An important factor to ensure the quality of any given piece of code is to test it. The test should preferably be automated and be run on every code check-in. The automation can be done through a language-native test framework like NUnit, JUnit or PHPUnit and then have a continuous integration system like Travis or TeamCity execute these tests every time code is pushed to the repository on GitHub. Code quality of course depends on a lot of other factors too, such as: Following best practice of the language and environment the code is being written in. Adhering to established style guides. Good understanding of The Principles of Object Oriented Design. A good domain architecture, modelled after Domain Driven Design. Accessibility The perhaps most important measure of success for an open source project is whether people outside of the project’s core development group contribute to it or not. The contributions can be everything from reported issues to correcting typographic errors in documentation to pull requests for minor or major code contributions. To be able to attract outside contributors, the project needs to be accessible. While accessibility is an abstract term, it can be broken down into smaller and more concrete parts that are easier to measure and understand. Is the development process for the project easy to understand? Where are outstanding features listed, who are the developers working on which features and where do they reside? How easy is it to fork the project and make a pull request that has a high chance of being merged? These are questions that should be asked and that can be answered confidently if the project is managed in a good and orderly fashion. The following list enumerates the most important aspects that a project should be governed by to be perceived as accessible: Outstanding features and bugs should be easy to find in the list of “issues” in the project’s repository. The project’s documentation should be easily accessible in or linked to from the project’s README file. The README file and associated documentation should be written in simple Markdown markup so it is easy to correct by anyone simply by using GitHub’s online Markdown editing features. How to contribute should be clearly explained in a CONTRIBUTING file. The process of contributing should be as simple as possible. The project should follow the norm and best practice of the language and environment it is written in. There should be tests in the project that are easy to get up and running on a developer machine without installing any external services, tools or libraries, unless they are handled by a package manager like NuGet. Contributed code should be checked by a continuous integration server that labels the status of pull request accordingly. If a test fails, the contributor should be alerted of its failure through GitHub’s interface. All code contributions should be run through a public continuous integration server so build failures are visible to the contributor such that he or she can fix it without any project manager’s involvement. The development and branching process should preferably be based on an existing scheme such as GitFlow or GitHub Flow. All development should be done in public. Code should be pushed to GitHub regularly, so it’s possible to see progress. For incomplete features and bugfixes, GitFlow with branch prefixes such as feature/ and hotfix/ should be used All code in development should be pushed as often as possible. Security All source code should be written in a secure way so it avoids the problems enumerated in OWASP Top 10 and SANS 25. It should preferably exist a test for each of these problems such that it is continually verified that the code does not contain any of these problems now or in the future. No source code should contain secrets, passwords or otherwise sensitive information. If such code is committed by accident, history should be rewritten through interactive rebasing as soon as possible and force-pushed. Licensing All of PayEx’ open source software should be licensed under a liberal [software license][software-license]. Copyright The copyright for code written in PayEx’ open source projects is shared between Swedbank Pay and the individual authors of the source code. This should be stated in the above mentioned LICENSE file as well as in each individual source code file and other metadata (such as .NET assembly information, etc.): Copyright © Swedbank Pay and Project Contributors How to Contribute Contributing details how we ensure that contributors to a project adheres to the rules and principles defined by the project. Code of Conduct Every project governed by Swedbank Pay or in its name should have a Code of Conduct. Release Management An essential part of any software project is having it released in one form or another so other people can use it. To be able to release software efficiently, several different strategies and methodologies need to exist and be followed. They will be described in the following chapters. Versioning To release software, it needs to be versioned. PayEx’ open source modules should be versioned according to semantic versioning. This means that whenever backward compatibility is broken, the major version should be incremented. When a new feature is added, the minor version should be incremented and when bug fixes and other minor changes are introduced, the revision number should be incremented. A version of the software should correspond to a commit in the Git repository. This commit should be tagged with the version number it represents and the commit should be in the branch corresponding with what’s being released; stable code should be in the master branch, while pre-release, alpha or beta code should be in the develop branch or in a release/ prefixed branch. If a stable version 1.2.5 of a project is to be released, the commit representing that version should be tagged in Git with the value 1.2.5 and the commit should exist in the master branch. To help with automating versioning in .NET based projects, GitVersion can be used. For most uses, GitVersionTask performs the job perfectly. It understands GitFlow and increments the version number automatically based on which branch the code being built exists on. Branching strategy To make versioning easier, the Git repository should follow GitFlow, GitHub Flow or derivates, so released and stable code is kept in the master branch, while unstable and pre-released code — if such is required — is kept in the develop branch. While they can be considered optional since all ongoing development can be done directly in the develop branch; features, hotfixes and such should preferably be done in separate branches using the GitFlow-standard branch prefixes feature, hotfix/, etc. Releases Software written for an environment that has a marketplace or other official storefront for applications (or “modules”, “extensions” and what have you) such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play, should try to publish the released software in these marketplaces. Releases should correspond to a tagged version number and a Release for the version should be created on GitHub. The GitHub Release should summarize all changes made since the last release and highlight new features, possibly by referring to blog entries or similar that describes them in more detail. To help with writing release notes, projects can use the tool GitReleaseNotes.",

Visit our demoshop and try out Swedbank Pay Checkout for yourself! Swedbank Pay Checkout allows your customers to be identified with Swedbank Pay, enabling existing Swedbank Pay Checkout users to pay with their favorite payment methods in just a few simple steps. Prerequisites To start integrating Swedbank Pay Checkout, you need the following: HTTPS enabled web server. Agreement that includes Swedbank Pay Checkout. Obtained credentials (merchant Access Token) from Swedbank Pay through Swedbank Pay Admin. Please observe that Swedbank Pay Checkout encompass both the consumer and paymentmenu scope. Introduction To get started with Swedbank Pay Checkout, you should learn about its different components and how they work together. Swedbank Pay Checkout consists of two related, but disconnected concepts: Checkin and Payment Menu. Checkin identifies the consumer in our Consumer API and Payment Menu authorizes the payment with our Payment Menu API. The next step is to Capture the payment. You can either capture the total amount, or do a part-capture (as described under After Payment). Connect these steps and you have Swedbank Pay Checkout. Under, you will see a sequence diagram showing the sequence of a Swedbank Pay checkout. info Note that in this diagram, the Payer refers to the merchant front-end (website) while Merchant refers to the merchant back-end. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay participant 3rdParty rect rgba(238, 112, 35, 0.05) note left of Payer: Checkin Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Start Checkin Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: POST /psp/consumers deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel:view-consumer-identification ① deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Show Checkin on Merchant Page Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Initiate Consumer Hosted View (open iframe) ② Payer -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Consumer UI page in iframe ③ deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;- Payer: Consumer identification process activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Consumer identification process deactivate Payer SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;- Payer: show consumer completed iframe activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: EVENT: onConsumerIdentified (consumerProfileRef) ④ deactivate Payer end rect rgba(138, 205, 195, 0.1) activate Payer note left of Payer: Payment Menu Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Initiate Purchase deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: POST /psp/paymentorders (paymentUrl, consumerProfileRef) deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel:view-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Display Payment Menu on Merchant Page activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer --&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Do payment logic deactivate SwedbankPay Payer -&gt;&gt; SwedbankPay: Do payment logic deactivate Payer opt Consumer perform payment out of iFrame activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Redirect to 3rd party Payer -&gt;&gt;+ 3rdParty: Redirect to 3rdPartyUrl URL deactivate Payer 3rdParty --&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Redirect back to paymentUrl (merchant) deactivate 3rdParty Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer end SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Payer: Payment status alt If payment is completed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: onPaymentCompleted Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET &lt;paymentorder.id&gt; deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if paid-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end opt If payment is failed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: OnPaymentFailed Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET {paymentorder.id} deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if failed-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end activate Merchant Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Show Purchase complete opt PaymentOrder Callback (if callbackUrls is set) activate Payer deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt; Merchant: POST Payment Callback end end rect rgba(81,43,43,0.1) activate Merchant note left of Payer: Capture Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: rel:create-paymentorder-capture deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;- Merchant: Capture status note right of Merchant: Capture here only if the purchased&lt;br/&gt;goods don't require shipping.&lt;br/&gt;If shipping is required, perform capture&lt;br/&gt;after the goods have shipped.&lt;br&gt;Should only be used for &lt;br&gt;PaymentInstruments that support &lt;br&gt;Authorizations. end Explanations Under, you see a list of notes that explains some of the sequences in the diagram.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay MobilePay Online Payments",
    "text": "MobilePay is the fast and simple way of paying with your mobile phone, reaching more than 4 million Danish end-users. MobilePay is the main Danish payment app for mobile phones, making it one of the essential payment instruments for merchants operating in Denmark. More than 4 million Danes are users of the app, and more than 100,000 merchants are accepting payments. We offer it on our redirect and seamless view platforms. Purchase flow After the payment is created, the consumer is redirected to MobilePay’s own payment page where the phone number is entered, and a push message is sent to the phone. A countdown is shown in the browser and the payment request will appear in the app, waiting to be confirmed by the consumer. If you are using the redirect option, the consumer will be redirected back to the merchant’s site. Good To Know Intent Authorization (two-phase): The intent of a MobilePay Online purchase is always Authorization. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. if a physical product, when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Payment Type MobilePay Online is one of the instruments using two-phase payments. The authorization is done when the consumer successfully confirms in the app, and the abort, cancel, capture or reversal is done by the merchant at a later time. Read more about the different operations and the payment resource. Settlement MobilePay Online transactions are handled, processed and settled as card transactions in our system. They are, however, tagged as MobilePay Online transactions and have their own acquirer agreement, so the two payment instruments are settled separately. 3-D Secure As MobilePay Online transactions are processed as card transactions, a 3-D Secure agreement is needed to complete the payment instrument setup. This information is provided to you by your acquirer when you set up your agreement with them. If you offer both Card Payments and MobilePay Online, you will need two separate 3-D Secure agreements, one for each payment instrument. Apart from the agreement with the acquirer, no further 3-D Secure compliance is required from you as a merchant in this regard. Demoshop MobilePay Online is unfortunately not available in our demoshop at the moment, but it will be in the future. The demoshop in the test environments will use a fakeservice which enables you to test a successful purchase without using the MobilePay app. Languages ​MobilePay supports the following languages: Danish da-DK, English (US) en-US, Finnish fi-FI, Norwegian nb-NO and Swedish sv-SE.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Swish",
    "text": "Swish is Sweden’s main payment app and the preferred online payment method with the highest convertion rates. Swish is the main Swedish payment app for mobile phones supported by all Swedish banks, making it one of the essential payment instruments for merchants operating in Sweden. According to Kantar Sifo, it is the preferred online payment method in the age group 18-40, and the payment method with the best convertion rates. We offer both desktop and mobile phone payment flows in our Redirect and Seamless View integrations, in addition to Direct API and Payment Link. Three flexible ways of integrating, two conversion optimized payment flows. Using the Direct API integration will put you in charge of determining which device is being used, and whether the e- or m-commerce flow is the most suitable. We will do this for you in Redirect and Seamless view. Payment Flow The following is a quick presentation of the purchase flow when using the Redirect or Seamless view. You can find in-depth descriptions of the separate flows in the corresponding sections. In the desktop intended e-commerce flow, the payer enters a Swish connected mobile phone number on Swedbank Pay’s payment page (Redirect) or in the iframe (Seamless View) after the payment is created. After pushing the pay button, the payer needs to open the Swish app and confirm the payment. If you are using the Redirect option, the payer will be Redirected back to the merchant’s site. In the mobile phone intended m-commerce flow, the payment page or iframe will only have a pay button, and no mobile phone number input is needed. The Swish app will be launched automatically when you push the pay button. Good To Know Intent The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be effectuated. This determines the type of transaction used during the payment process. Authorization (two-phase): If you want the credit card to reserve the amount, you will have to specify that the intent of the Purchase is Authorization. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request later on to fulfill the transaction. Sale (one-phase): The sale intent is used by the payment instruments like Swish, where the funds are reserved and drawn from the payer’s account immediately. This means you don’t need to do any more financial operations to fulfill the transaction. The only available after payment operation is reversal. Payment Type Swish is one of the instruments using one-phase payments. The sale is done when the consumer successfully confirms in the app, capturing the funds instantly. The abort operation is still available, but the cancel and capture operations are not. The reversal, if needed, is done by the merchant at a later time. Read more about the different operations and the payment resource. Certificate We recommend that you apply for Swish as part of our Settlement Service and utilize our Technical Supplier Certificate. A Swedbank Pay sales representative can assist you with this. The Settlement Service will provide you with aggregated and reconciled reports and payments. The Technical Supplier Certificate means setup will be quicker and you will not have to assign a point of contact to monitor and renew a certificate. You could also contact one of the following banks offering Swish Handel: Danske Bank, SEB, Länsförsäkringar, Sparbanken Syd, Sparbanken Öresund, Nordea, Handelsbanken, in order to get an acquiring agreement, a Swish alias and access to Swish Certificate Management system (several banks do however support Technical Supplier Certificate setups so you can ask them for that). Demoshop You can give Swish a go in our demoshop if you like. For Redirect payments, you need to toggle paymentUrl off, if you want to try Seamless View, paymentUrl must be toggled on. The external integration demoshop used for testing is set up with the Merchant Swish Simulator, which enables you to test without using the Swish App. Languages ​Swish supports the following languages: English (US) en-US, Norwegian nb-NO and Swedish sv-SE.

Platform options Here are our three platform options at a glance. You can read more about the integration process by visiting the sections for each payment instrument. Seamless View With Seamless Views you can initiate the payment process directly in an iframe on your site. If you prefer that the consumer isn’t redirected away from you, this option enables you to embed our payment page seamlessly into your shopping experience. Redirect The Redirect platform redirects the consumers to a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. The consumer will be redirected back to your page when the payment is completed. Direct Direct is the option where you integrate directly using our Direct API. This is an integration with the most flexibility and opportunities. If you want to offer Card Payments and choose this option, you have to be PCI-DSS compliant. The Fundamentals info All Payments APIs in the Swedbank Pay API Platform share a common foundation with a similar payment process for all payment instruments, reducing complexity and enabling a more straightforward integration. There are two main payment types, two-phase and one-phase payments. The two seem very similar from a consumer’s point of view, but there are key differences you should know about. Two-Phase Payments A two-phase payment is performed in two steps – an authorization which reserves the consumer’s funds, and a capture of the funds at a later time, usually when the goods are shipped. This is the most common payment type, and it is used by Card Payments, Vipps Payments, MobilePay payments and Invoice Payments. A capture of an invoice will not capture any funds, but trigger the invoice distribution and send it to the consumer. The payment instruments that support two-phase payments are: Card Invoice MobilePay Vipps One-Phase Payments There are two types of one-phase payments – sale and autoCapture. sale is used by payment instruments such as Swish. These payments will have a sale transaction instead of the authorization and capture. The funds will be captured from the consumer straight away. autoCapture is only available for Card Payments. The mechanics work the same way as a two-phase payment, with two separate transactions – one for the authorization and one for the capture. As the name implies, the capture transaction is performed automatically when the authorization is successful. Because of this, autoCapture should only be used when dealing with digital products, since they are shipped instantly. As the funds are captured instantly, cancel is not available for either of the one-phase payments. abort and reversal can be performed the same way as with two-phase payments. The payment instruments that support one-phase payments are: Swish Card The Payment Object The payment is the container object that holds all transactions created during the payment process. When Swedbank Pay receives the payment request body (in JSON format), a payment is created and you will be given a unique payment ID in return. The response also includes (in a true RESTful way) the URIs and operations for further actions, given the state of the payment. After creating a payment, you can: Authorize funds. An authorization transaction reserves the funds. It is possible to abort a payment before the end user has completed the payment process. And either: Capture funds. Before delivering the merchandise you need to create a capture transaction to ensure that the money is charged from the consumer credit card or properly billed by invoice. One-phase payments will combine these two in a sale or autoCapture transaction as described in the section above. Or: Cancel the authorized amount. Funds that are authorized but not yet captured, can be released back to the consumer. This is done by creating a cancel transaction. This is not available for one-phase payments. Reverse captured funds. In some cases you may need to make a reversal of captured funds. This is achieved by creating a reversal transaction. All actions after creating the payment can be done by using our APIs, or from our admin tool. abort is only available when using APIs.

Screenshots for Payments You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the card information. API Requests for Payments The API requests are displayed in the purchase flow. You can create a card payment with following operation options: Purchase Recur Payout Verify Our payment example below uses the Purchase value. Purchase flow mobile The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of a complete purchase, and the two requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay. The links will take you directly to the corresponding API description. When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are two alternative outcomes of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API Request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: authorization page activate Payer note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase result sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase activate Payer Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments activate Merchant note left of Payer: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: authorization page activate Merchant Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authorization page activate Payer note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase information activate SwedbankPay Payer-&gt;&gt;Payer: input creditcard information Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: submit creditcard information activate Payer opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: redirect to IssuingBank activate SwedbankPay Payer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate Payer end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: redirect to merchant activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: redirect back to merchant Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Payer Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; activate Merchant note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;Payer: display purchase result activate Merchant opt Callback is set activate SwedbankPay SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Payment is updated SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: POST Payment Callback activate SwedbankPay end Back: Direct Next: After Payment",

CompleteUrl This URL will be used by Swedbank Pay when a payment is Completed or Failed. If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl.

Settlement and Reconciliation Reconciliation is an important step in an economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees. Transactions List The Transaction List (provided in .xlsx and .xml formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment instrument. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for human interaction. The first row contains the name of the Swedbank Pay company (e.g. Swedbank Pay Solutions AB) that the merchant has the contract with, and the balance report number. The header fields contain a summary of the transactions displayed in the body. Header fields Field Type Description Prefix String The Prefix used for transactions, only eligible if merchant uses prefix. Currency ISO 4217 Settlement currency (e.g. SEK, NOK, EUR).

Reconciliation To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system against the information provided by Swedbank Pay in the balance report and transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction. sequenceDiagram participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Merchant activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Online payment transactions deactivate Merchant deactivate SwedbankPay activate Merchant SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file) note left of Merchant: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file) SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file) deactivate Merchant There are two ways for you to match the information from your system with the information given in the reconciliation files from Swedbank Pay: You can use information generated by your system (you will have to set a unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or You can use the transaction number generated by Swedbank Pay (this is called transaction number and is returned from Swedbank Pay after you have created the transaction). A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the payeeReference. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called OrderID in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"transaction\": { \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 0, \"description\": \"Test Reversal\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\" } } When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include transaction.number. This is the same as the field called TransactionNo in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 { \"payment\": \"/psp/mobilepay/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1\", \"capture\": { \"id\": \"/psp/mobilepay/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/captures/ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"transaction\": { \"id\": \"/psp/mobilepay/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/transactions/ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"created\": \"2016-09-14T01:01:01.01Z\", \"updated\": \"2016-09-14T01:01:01.03Z\", \"type\": \"Capture\", \"state\": \"Initialized\", \"number\": 1234567890, \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 250, \"description\": \"Test Capture\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\", \"failedReason\": \"\", \"isOperational\": false, \"operations\": [] } } } payeeReference sent to Swedbank Pay is equal to OrderId in the reconciliation file. capture.transaction.number returned from Swedbank Pay is equal to TransactionNo in reconciliation file. Samples The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with Swedbank Pay. For some payment instruments, only option A is available, while for other payment instruments, only option B is available. The sample files can be downloaded below. Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Split Settlement The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both your sub merchants and yourself. In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres, sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to charities. What we need from you as a company Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include. We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security for you. Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you send to us. We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system. Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched to the correct merchant in our back office system. A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts and fees. How it works We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems. The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you create the payment for the goods or service. The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment. The payment goes into the client funds account. Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix number. The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant. Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted automatically. Payout to the sub merchant is done. The upsides Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you: Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway. Only need one acquiring agreement. Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate. Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once. Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us to a matter of hours. The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Payment Link The implementation sequence for this scenario is a variant of the purchase sequence. The consumer is not redirected to the Payments directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link, a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for payment instruments listed below, using the Redirect platform and Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. Credit card MobilePay Swish Vipps When the consumer/end-user starts the purchase process in your merchant or webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the consumer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. info When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next section. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If callbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. E-mail And SMS Recommendations When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms &amp; Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Receipt Recommendations We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API Requests The API requests depend on the payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture, cancellation or reversal. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Purchase are listed below. Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered. Options All valid options when posting in a payment with operation Purchase, are described in each payment instrument’s respective API reference. Please see the general sequence diagrams for more information about payments in one-phase (e.g. Swish and credit card with autocapture) and two-phase (e.g. Credit card, MobilePay, Vipps). Authorization When using two-phase flows you reserve the amount with an authorization, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is Authorize. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Capture Capture can only be performed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. If you want the credit card to be charged right away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is AutoCapture. The credit card will be charged and you don’t need to do any more financial operations to this purchase. Cancel Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount. Reversal Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed. General When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Purchase flow The sequence diagrams display the high level process of the purchase, from generating a Payment Link to receiving a Callback. This in a generalized flow as well as a specific 3-D Secure enabled credit card scenario. info Please note that the the callback may come either before, after or in the same moment as the consumer are being redirected to the status page at the merchant site when the purchase is fulfilled. Don’t rely on the callback being timed at any specific moment. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: consumer starts purchase activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase process activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST [payment] (operation=PURCHASE) activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource with payment URL activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: Payment URL sent to order system activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: Distribute Payment URL through e-mail/SMS activate Consumer note left of Consumer: Payment Link in e-mail/SMS Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: Open link and enter payment information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to merchant site activate Consumer note left of SwedbankPay: redirect back to merchant Consumer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET [payment] activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: display purchase result Options after posting a payment If the payment enable a two-phase flow (Authorize), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests. It is possible to “abort” the validity of the Payment Link. See the Abort description here. For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request. When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Description The description field is a 40 character length textual summary of the purchase. It is needed to specify what payer is actually purchasing. Below you will find an abbreviated Card Payments Purchase request. As you can see the description field is set to be test purchase - orderNumber28749347 in the the code example. The images below will show you the payment UI for the Redirect and Seamless View scenario. info Notice that for Redirect, the description will be shown as test purchase - orderNumber28749347, as set in the code example. For the Seamless View scenario, the description is not shown in the payment window, but it is still required in the initial request.

Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

Completed - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to completion. Failed - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment order gets the state failed as well).

Required Field Type Description check ︎︎︎︎︎ hostUrls array The array of URIs valid for embedding of Swedbank Pay Hosted Views. check completeUrl string The URL that Swedbank Pay will redirect back to when the payer has completed his or her interactions with the payment. This does not indicate a successful payment, only that it has reached a final (complete) state. A GET request needs to be performed on the payment order to inspect it further. check termsOfServiceUrl string The URI to the terms of service document the payer must accept in order to complete the payment. Note that this field is not required unless generateReferenceToken or generateRecurrenceToken is also submitted in the request. This is the Merchants, not the Swedbank Pay Terms of Service. HTTPS is a requirement.   cancelUrl string The URI to redirect the payer to if the payment is canceled, either by the payer or by the merchant trough an abort request of the payment or paymentorder.   paymentUrl string The URI that Swedbank Pay will redirect back to when the payment menu needs to be loaded, to inspect and act on the current status of the payment.   callbackUrl string The URI to the API endpoint receiving POST requests on transaction activity related to the payment order.   logoUrl string The URI to the logo that will be displayed on redirect pages. HTTPS is a requirement. Payment Url For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting the payment instrument Vipps or in the 3-D Secure verification for Credit Card Payments. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Order Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment Order as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer. paymentUrl is used by the Seamless View flow and must be used for WebView-based app implementations. Some payment instruments only work when owning the full browser page (no use of &lt;iframe&gt;), this will be solved by doing a full browser (top frame) redirect out of the Seamless View. 3-D Secure requires this, for example. For mobile flows, some payment instruments work best when app-to-app switching is enabled and handled automatically (Swish, Vipps etc). To solve this, it is important that the third party app or site understand where to redirect the consumer back to after the flow on their end is completed. The paymentUrl is the URL Swedbank Pay will provide to the third party for handling the redirect back to your site or app. When receiving the consumer back on the paymentUrl either in an app or web page it is important to restore the Seamless View to let the payment finalize the flow. For in-app it is important that you either implement the onPaymentCompleted event or let the Seamless View redirect to the completeUrl before intercepting the WebView. If you intercept the WebView when the consumer device is redirected to the paymentUrl it can lead to issues. If you want to handle payment errors in your own code, you should also subscribe to other events provided by the Seamless View JavaScript and shut down the Seamless View if any of these events occur. Events to subscribe to for full control over the payment flow are: Event Description onError Will trigger any time a system error occur from the JavaScript. onPaymentFailed will call registrered endpoint if provided. If not subscribed to will redirect to conpleteUrl onPaymentCanceled will be called if the payment is aborted by the consumer or triggered by you with the Abort command on the payment onPaymentTransactionFailed this will trigger if one payment attempt failed. Standard functionality are to let the consumer be able to retry the payment from the payment page. When implementing the Seamless View flow into a WebView in your mobile app, you should use a custom scheme or Universal Link in the paymentUrl for handling automatic switching between your app and the payment app on the mobile device. URLs Resource It is possible to perform a GET request on the urls resource to retrieve its contents. Request 1 2 3 4 GET /psp/paymentorders/09ccd29a-7c4f-4752-9396-12100cbfecce/urls/ HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Content-Type: application/json Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json { \"paymentorder\": \"/psp/payments/09ccd29a-7c4f-4752-9396-12100cbfecce\", \"urls\": { \"id\": \"/psp/payments/09ccd29a-7c4f-4752-9396-12100cbfecce/urls\", \"hostUrls\": [ \"https://example.com\", \"https://example.net\" ], \"completeUrl\": \"https://example.com/payment-complete\", \"cancelUrl\": \"https://example.com/payment-canceled\", \"paymentUrl\": \"https://example.com/perform-payment\", \"callbackUrl\": \"http://api.example.com/payment-callback\", \"logoUrl\": \"http://merchant.com/path/to/logo.png\", \"termsOfServiceUrl\": \"http://merchant.com/path/to/tems\" } } Field Type Description paymentorder string The relative URI and unique identifier of the payment resource this urls belongs to..

The paymentOrders resource utilize several sub-resources, relating to underlying payments, the current payment active, payers and URLs. Common sub-resources like payeeinfo, that are structurally identical for both payments and payments orders, are described in the Payment Resources section. Operations When a payment order resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have a set of operations that can be performed on it. The state of the payment order resource, what the access token is authorized to do, the chosen payment instrument and its transactional states, etc. determine the available operations before the initial purchase. A list of possible operations and their explanation is given below.

Operation Description update-paymentorder-abort Aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. update-paymentorder-updateorder Updates the order with a change in the amount and/or vatAmount. redirect-paymentorder Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the Payment Menu. view-paymentorder Contains the JavaScript href that is used to embed the Payment Menu UI directly on the webshop/merchant site. create-paymentorder-capture The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. create-paymentorder-cancel Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount. create-paymentorder-reversal Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed. paid-paymentorder Returns the information about a paymentorder that has the status paid. failed-paymentorder Returns the information about a paymentorder that has the status failed. CompleteUrl This URL will be used by Swedbank Pay when a payment is Completed or Failed. If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl. You will still need to do a GET request on the payment resource to find the final status (Completed or Failed). View Payment Order The view-paymentorder operation contains the URI of the JavaScript that needs to be set as a script element’s src attribute, either client-side through JavaScript or server-side in HTML as shown below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Swedbank Pay Checkout is Awesome!&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=\"checkout\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/paymentmenu/core/scripts/client/px.paymentmenu.client.js?token=5a17c24e-d459-4567-bbad-aa0f17a76119&amp;culture=nb-NO\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script language=\"javascript\"&gt; payex.hostedView.paymentMenu({ container: 'checkout', culture: 'nb-NO', onPaymentCompleted: function(paymentCompletedEvent) { console.log(paymentCompletedEvent); }, onPaymentFailed: function(paymentFailedEvent) { console.log(paymentFailedEvent); }, onPaymentCreated: function(paymentCreatedEvent) { console.log(paymentCreatedEvent); }, onPaymentToS: function(paymentToSEvent) { console.log(paymentToSEvent); }, onPaymentMenuInstrumentSelected: function(paymentMenuInstrumentSelectedEvent) { console.log(paymentMenuInstrumentSelectedEvent); }, onError: function(error) { console.error(error); }, }).open(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Update Order Change amount and vat amount on a payment order.

The corresponding state of the payment order will in this case be set to pending. No further transactions can be created. Completed - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to completion. Failed - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment order gets the state failed as well).

Recurring Payments If you want to enable subsequent recurring – server-to-server – payments, you need to create a recurrence token. This token will be utilized after the initial payment order. Recurring payments must be activated on the contract with Swedbank Pay in order to work. Recurrence Token When initiating a Purchase payment order, you need to make sure that the field generateRecurrenceToken is set to true. This recurrence token will stored in the authorization transaction sub-resource on the underlying payment resource. When initiating a Verify payment order, a recurrence token will be generated automatically. This recurrence token is stored in the verification sub-resource on the underlying payment resource. You can view the current payment resource, containg the recurrence token and other payment instrument properties, by expanding the sub-resource currentpayment when doing a GET request on the paymentorders resource.

This will be a server-to-server affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the recurrence token during the initial payment order.

Purchase 1 2 3 4 5 { \"paymentorder\": { \"operation\": \"Purchase\" { } Verify Payments The Verify operation lets you post verifications to confirm the validity of credit card information, without reserving or charging any amount. This option is mainly used to initiate a recurring payment scenario where the card will be charged at a later date. The request body is equivalent to a Purchase order with credit card as the selected item. A recurrence token will be generated automatically, rendering the parameter generateRecurrenceToken unnecessary for this operation. Verify 1 2 3 4 5 { \"paymentorder\": { \"operation\": \"Verify\" { } Payments Resource A payment order is able to hold more than one payment object, even though a successful payment order only harbour one successful payment. This is necessary as the consumer might select and initiate a payment option that is not followed through successfully. I.e. if the consumer cancels an invoice payment, a cancel transaction will still be tied to that particular invoice payment resource. This payment resource will continue to exist, even if the consumer successfully should finish the purchase with a credit card payment instead.

Callback Setting a callbackUrl in the HTTP POST API is optional, but highly recommended. If a payer closes the browser window, a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirect from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callback is what ensures that you receive information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction.

Regardless of why the error occurred, the problem message will follow the same structure as specified in the Problem Details for HTTP APIs] specification. The structure of a problem message will look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \"type\": \"https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror\", \"title\": \"There was an input error\", \"detail\": \"Please correct the errors and retry the request\", \"instance\": \"ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"status\": 400, \"action\": \"RetryNewData\", \"problems\": [{ \"name\": \"CreditCardParameters.Issuer\", \"description\": \"minimum one issuer must be enabled \" }] } Field Type Description type string The URI that identifies the error type. This is the only field usable for programmatic identification of the type of error! When dereferenced, it might lead you to a human readable description of the error and how it can be recovered from. title string The title contains a human readable description of the error. detail string A detailed, human readable description of the error. instance string The identifier of the error instance. This might be of use to Swedbank Pay support personnel in order to find the exact error and the context it occurred in. status integer The HTTP status code that the problem was served with. action string The action indicates how the error can be recovered from. problems array The array of problem detail objects. └➔ [].name string The name of the field, header, object, entity or likewise that was erroneous. └➔ [].description string The description of what was wrong with the field, header, object, entity or likewise identified by name. Common Problems All common problem types will have a URI in the format https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/&lt;error-type&gt;. The URI is an identifier and is currently not possible to dereference, although that might be possible in the future. Type Status Description inputerror 400 The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request). forbidden 403 The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking. notfound 404 The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible. systemerror 500 A generic error message. configurationerror 500 A error relating to configuration issues. Expansion The payment resource contain the ID of related sub-resources in its response properties. These sub-resources can be expanded inline by using the request parameter expand. This is an effective way to limit the number of necessary calls to the API, as you return several properties related to a Payment resource in a single request. info Note that the expand parameter is available to all API requests but only applies to the request response. This means that you can use the expand parameter on a POST or PATCHrequest to get a response containing the target resource including expanded properties. This example below add the urls and authorizations field inlines to the response, enabling you to access information from these sub-resources. Expansion 1 2 GET /psp/paymentorders/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1?$expand=urls,authorizations HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com To avoid unnecessary overhead, you should only expand the nodes you need info about. PayeeInfo The payeeinfo resource contains information about the payee (i.e. a merchant, a corporation etc) related to a specific payment.

Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the payeeInfo resource this payeeInfo belongs to.. Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ payeeId string This is the unique id that identifies this payee (like merchant) set by Swedbank Pay └➔ payeeReference string(30) A unique reference set by the merchant system. See below for details └➔ payeeName string The payee name (like merchant name) that will be displayed to consumer when redirected to Swedbank Pay. └➔ productCategory string A product category or number sent in from the payee/merchant. This is not validated by Swedbank Pay, but will be passed through the payment process and may be used in the settlement process. You therefore need to ensure that the value given here is valid in the settlement. └➔ orderReference string(50) The order reference should reflect the order reference found in the merchant’s systems. Payee Reference The payeeReference given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract. It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system. Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the payeeReference is sent to the acquirer. If you select Option A in the settlement process (Swedbank Pay will handle the settlement), Swedbank Pay will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the payeeReference must be in the format of characters A-Za-z0-9 (including -) and string(30). If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), Swedbank Pay will send the payeeReference to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits. Merchant Authenticated Consumer When the consumer is identified and authenticated by the merchant, the consumer’s identity can be included in the Payment Order request. Merchant Authenticated Consumer is performed as an alternative to Checkin when creating the Payment Order upon the initializaiont of the Payment Menu. You can use Merchant Authenticated Consumer only if you have an agreement with Swedbank Pay. The additional nationalIdentifier field described below should be added to the paymentorder.payer object already in the Payment Order creation request, as an alternative to consumerProfileRef. warning Bank ID authentication required In order to use the Merchant Authenticated Consumer feature, you need a legal agreement with Swedbank Pay which mandates that the consumer identified by the nationalIdentifier is authenticated with Bank ID prior to the request. An example of how a Merchant Authenticated Consumer request looks like is provided below (abbreviated for brevity): Request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 POST /psp/paymentorders HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Content-Type: application/json { \"paymentorder\": { \"payer\": { \"nationalIdentifier\": { \"socialSecurityNumber\": \"199710202392\", \"countryCode\": \"SE\" } } } } Required Field Type Description check paymentorder object The payment order object.   └➔ payer object The payer object containing information about the payer relevant for the payment order.   └─➔ nationalIdentifier string The national identifier object.   └──➔ socialSecurityNumber string The consumers social security number. Must be part of what you get from your authentication process.   └──➔ countryCode string The countrycode of the consumer. When the consumer is authenticated by the Merchant, some payment instruments will allow a more frictionless payment process. Invoice One-Click payments does not require the last 4/5 digits in the payer’s social security number (SSN), for instance. Below you can see an example of how the payment window looks like with and without Merchant Authenticated Consumer. To the left, the SSN is removed altogether because the payer is authenticated by the Merchant, and to the right the last 4/5 digits of the SSN required as usual. Settlement and Reconciliation Reconciliation is an important step in an economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees. Transactions List The Transaction List (provided in .xlsx and .xml formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment instrument. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for human interaction. The first row contains the name of the Swedbank Pay company (e.g. Swedbank Pay Solutions AB) that the merchant has the contract with, and the balance report number. The header fields contain a summary of the transactions displayed in the body. Header fields Field Type Description Prefix String The Prefix used for transactions, only eligible if merchant uses prefix. Currency ISO 4217 Settlement currency (e.g. SEK, NOK, EUR). ServiceType String The service type of the service used (e.g. Creditcard). Service String The service used (e.g. Creditcard).

Referenced Transaction Number Decimal Transaction number for the Authoriation transaction for a two-stage transaction or the number of the debit transaction if it is a credit transaction. Sales Channel String The channel through which the transaction was sent to Swedbank Pay (e.g Transaction via eCommerce APIs). Brand String If eligible, Branding information as sent by merchant to PayEx. Point Of Sale String If eligible, POS information as sent by merchant to PayEx. Reconciliation To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system against the information provided by Swedbank Pay in the balance report and transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction. sequenceDiagram participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Merchant activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Online payment transactions deactivate Merchant deactivate SwedbankPay activate Merchant SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file) note left of Merchant: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file) SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file) deactivate Merchant There are two ways for you to match the information from your system with the information given in the reconciliation files from Swedbank Pay: You can use information generated by your system (you will have to set a unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or You can use the transaction number generated by Swedbank Pay (this is called transaction number and is returned from Swedbank Pay after you have created the transaction). A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the payeeReference. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called OrderID in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"transaction\": { \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 0, \"description\": \"Test Reversal\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\" } } When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include transaction.number. This is the same as the field called TransactionNo in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 { \"payment\": \"/psp/paymentorders/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1\", \"capture\": { \"id\": \"/psp/paymentorders/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/captures/ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"transaction\": { \"id\": \"/psp/paymentorders/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/transactions/ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"created\": \"2016-09-14T01:01:01.01Z\", \"updated\": \"2016-09-14T01:01:01.03Z\", \"type\": \"Capture\", \"state\": \"Initialized\", \"number\": 1234567890, \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 250, \"description\": \"Test Capture\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\", \"failedReason\": \"\", \"isOperational\": false, \"operations\": [] } } } payeeReference sent to Swedbank Pay is equal to OrderId in the reconciliation file. capture.transaction.number returned from Swedbank Pay is equal to TransactionNo in reconciliation file. Samples The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with Swedbank Pay. For some payment instruments, only option A is available, while for other payment instruments, only option B is available. The sample files can be downloaded below. Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Split Settlement The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both your sub merchants and yourself. In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres, sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to charities. What we need from you as a company Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include. We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security for you. Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you send to us. We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system. Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched to the correct merchant in our back office system. A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts and fees. How it works We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems. The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you create the payment for the goods or service. The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment. The payment goes into the client funds account. Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix number. The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant. Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted automatically. Payout to the sub merchant is done. The upsides Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you: Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway. Only need one acquiring agreement. Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate. Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once. Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us to a matter of hours. The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Updating Payment Menu When the contents of the shopping cart changes or anything else that affects the amount occurs, the paymentorder must be updated and the Payment Menu must be refreshed. info Features that are not described in the previous sections must not be used, although they are available in the API. Flags that can be turned to true must be kept false as described in this standard setup documentation. info Your integration must be resilient to change. Properties, operations, headers, etc., that aren’t understood in any response must be ignored. Don’t expect a specific order of elements. When in doubt, please follow the robustness principle.

Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ number integer The payment number , useful when there’s need to reference the payment in human communication. Not usable for programmatic identification of the payment, for that id should be used instead. └➔ created string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was created. └➔ updated string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was updated. └➔ state string Ready, Pending, Failed or Aborted. Indicates the state of the payment, not the state of any transactions performed on the payment. To find the state of the payment’s transactions (such as a successful authorization), see the transactions resource or the different specialized type-specific resources such as authorizations or sales. └➔ prices object The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment. └➔ prices.id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the prices resource . Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ description string(40) A 40 character length textual description of the purchase. └➔ payerReference string The reference to the payer (consumer/end-user) from the merchant system, like e-mail address, mobile number, customer number etc. └➔ userAgent string The user agent string of the consumer’s browser. └➔ language string sv-SE, nb-NO or ee-EE. └➔ urls string The URI to the urls resource where all URIs related to the payment can be retrieved. └➔ payeeInfo string The URI to the payeeinfo resource where the information about the payee of the payment can be retrieved. operations array The array of possible operations to perform └─➔ method string The HTTP method to use when performing the operation. └─➔ href string The target URI to perform the operation against. └─➔ rel string The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource. Operations The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the href and method as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its rel value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the rel and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation. Operation Description update-payment-abort aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. redirect-authorization Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the card authorization UI. view-authorization Contains the JavaScript href that is used to embed the card authorization UI directly on the webshop/merchant site create-capture Creates a capture transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer. create-cancellation Creates a cancellation transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment. Payment States And Transaction States Both payments and transactions can be in several different states during the course of a purchase. You can find a short description of each state below. Payments ready means that the payment has been created successfully, and is now ready for further transaction operations, like authorization, sale or abort. failed means that something went wrong during the payment process, and no further transactions can be created if the payment is in this state. Examples of possible failures are triggering of anti-fraud protection or if the payer reaches the maximum number of attempts for a given payment. aborted means that the merchant has aborted the payment before the end user has fulfilled the payment process. This is done by calling the PATCH function for abort operations. pending is the state of a payment when a transaction is in an initialized state. See more below. As long as a payment is pending, no further transactions can be done. Transactions ìntialized is the transaction state when something unexpected occured, and it is impossible to determine the exact status of the transaction. An example of this can be a network failure. No further actions can be done on a payment with a transaction in this state. completed means that the transaction has reached its intended purpose. An authorization will be completed when the funds have been authorized, a capture will be completed when the funds have been captured and a reversal will be completed when the payer has been refunded. failed means that the transaction has failed. The state is final for that specific transaction, but given that the payment is operational, it is possible to perform more transactions on the same payment, i.e. retry the authorization with another card. If the payer reaches the maximum amount of retries, the payment itself will be set to failed. awaitingActivity is in use for a selection of payment instruments. A transaction reaches this state when a payer is sent away from Swedbank Pay to do a confirmation or verification. Examples of this can be payment apps like Swish, Vipps or MobilePay, or 3-D Secure verifications for card payments. Create Payment Within the invoice payments part of the eCommerce API, you can create four kinds of payments (FinancingConsumer, Verify, and Recur), and you can inspect and alter the details of the individual transactions within the payment. To create a invoice payment, you perform an HTTP POST against the payments resource. There are four different kinds of payment that can be created. These are identified with the value of the operation field. Each kind are documented in their own section below.

FinancingConsumer. Used to create a new invoice to be sent to the payer. Recur. Used to charge a card on a recurring basis. Is followed up by a capture or cancel operation (if not Autocapture is used, that is). Verify. Used when authorizing a card withouth reserveing any funds. It is followed up by a verification transaction. check └➔ intent string The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be effectuated. This determine the type transactions used during the payment process. Authorization. Reserves the amount, and is followed by a cancellation or capture of funds. Financing Consumer A FinancingConsumer payment is an invoice.

Introduction to Verify This option is commonly used when initiating a subsequent recurring invoice payment flow - where you do not want to charge the consumer right away. Verification through Swedbank Pay Payments When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer initiates a verification operation, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Verify information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a JavaScript source in response. You need to redirect the payer’s browser to that specified URL, or embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an iframe; so that she can enter the payment details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer’s browser to - or display directly in the iframe - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a GET request to receive the state of the transaction. Finally you will make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the paymentID received in the first step, which will return the payment result and a paymentToken that can be used for subsequent recurring server-to-server based payments. Screenshots You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the payment information. API Requests The API requests are displayed in the Verification flow.

The corresponding state of the payment order will in this case be set to pending. No further transactions can be created. Completed - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to completion. Failed - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment order gets the state failed as well).

Callback When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform a callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

The consumer is not redirected to the Payments directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link, a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for payment instruments listed below, using the Redirect platform and Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. Credit card MobilePay Swish Vipps When the consumer/end-user starts the purchase process in your merchant or webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the consumer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. info When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next section. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If callbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. E-mail And SMS Recommendations When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms &amp; Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Receipt Recommendations We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API Requests The API requests depend on the payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture, cancellation or reversal. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Purchase are listed below. Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered. Options All valid options when posting in a payment with operation Purchase, are described in each payment instrument’s respective API reference. Please see the general sequence diagrams for more information about payments in one-phase (e.g. Swish and credit card with autocapture) and two-phase (e.g. Credit card, MobilePay, Vipps). Authorization When using two-phase flows you reserve the amount with an authorization, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is Authorize. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Capture Capture can only be performed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. If you want the credit card to be charged right away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is AutoCapture. The credit card will be charged and you don’t need to do any more financial operations to this purchase. Cancel Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount. Reversal Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed. General When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Purchase flow The sequence diagrams display the high level process of the purchase, from generating a Payment Link to receiving a Callback. This in a generalized flow as well as a specific 3-D Secure enabled credit card scenario. info Please note that the the callback may come either before, after or in the same moment as the consumer are being redirected to the status page at the merchant site when the purchase is fulfilled. Don’t rely on the callback being timed at any specific moment. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: consumer starts purchase activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase process activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST [payment] (operation=PURCHASE) activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource with payment URL activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: Payment URL sent to order system activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: Distribute Payment URL through e-mail/SMS activate Consumer note left of Consumer: Payment Link in e-mail/SMS Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: Open link and enter payment information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to merchant site activate Consumer note left of SwedbankPay: redirect back to merchant Consumer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET [payment] activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: display purchase result Options after posting a payment If the payment enable a two-phase flow (Authorize), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests. It is possible to “abort” the validity of the Payment Link. See the Abort description here. For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request. When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. CompleteUrl This URL will be used by Swedbank Pay when a payment is Completed or Failed. If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl. You will still need to do a GET request on the payment resource to find the final status (Completed or Failed). Description The description field is a 40 character length textual summary of the purchase. It is needed to specify what payer is actually purchasing. Below you will find an abbreviated Card Payments Purchase request. As you can see the description field is set to be test purchase - orderNumber28749347 in the the code example. The images below will show you the payment UI for the Redirect and Seamless View scenario. info Notice that for Redirect, the description will be shown as test purchase - orderNumber28749347, as set in the code example.

Invoice Payments Type Description Invoice Always Invoice Settlement and Reconciliation Reconciliation is an important step in an economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees. Transactions List The Transaction List (provided in .xlsx and .xml formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment instrument. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for human interaction.

Reconciliation To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system against the information provided by Swedbank Pay in the balance report and transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction. sequenceDiagram participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Merchant activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Online payment transactions deactivate Merchant deactivate SwedbankPay activate Merchant SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file) note left of Merchant: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file) SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file) deactivate Merchant There are two ways for you to match the information from your system with the information given in the reconciliation files from Swedbank Pay: You can use information generated by your system (you will have to set a unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or You can use the transaction number generated by Swedbank Pay (this is called transaction number and is returned from Swedbank Pay after you have created the transaction). A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the payeeReference. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called OrderID in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"transaction\": { \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 0, \"description\": \"Test Reversal\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\" } } When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include transaction.number.

Samples The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with Swedbank Pay. For some payment instruments, only option A is available, while for other payment instruments, only option B is available. The sample files can be downloaded below. Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Split Settlement The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both your sub merchants and yourself. In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres, sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to charities. What we need from you as a company Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include. We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security for you. Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you send to us. We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system. Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched to the correct merchant in our back office system. A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts and fees. How it works We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems. The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you create the payment for the goods or service. The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment. The payment goes into the client funds account. Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix number. The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant. Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted automatically. Payout to the sub merchant is done. The upsides Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you: Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway. Only need one acquiring agreement. Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate. Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once. Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us to a matter of hours. The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Problems When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a problem message. We generally use the problem message type and status code to identify the nature of the problem. The problem name and description will often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.

Operation Description update-payment-abort aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. create-capture Creates a capture transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer. create-cancellation Creates a cancellation transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment. Payment States And Transaction States Both payments and transactions can be in several different states during the course of a purchase. You can find a short description of each state below. Payments ready means that the payment has been created successfully, and is now ready for further transaction operations, like authorization, sale or abort. failed means that something went wrong during the payment process, and no further transactions can be created if the payment is in this state. Examples of possible failures are triggering of anti-fraud protection or if the payer reaches the maximum number of attempts for a given payment. aborted means that the merchant has aborted the payment before the end user has fulfilled the payment process. This is done by calling the PATCH function for abort operations. pending is the state of a payment when a transaction is in an initialized state. See more below. As long as a payment is pending, no further transactions can be done. Transactions ìntialized is the transaction state when something unexpected occured, and it is impossible to determine the exact status of the transaction. An example of this can be a network failure. No further actions can be done on a payment with a transaction in this state. completed means that the transaction has reached its intended purpose. An authorization will be completed when the funds have been authorized, a capture will be completed when the funds have been captured and a reversal will be completed when the payer has been refunded. failed means that the transaction has failed. The state is final for that specific transaction, but given that the payment is operational, it is possible to perform more transactions on the same payment, i.e. retry the authorization with another card. If the payer reaches the maximum amount of retries, the payment itself will be set to failed. awaitingActivity is in use for a selection of payment instruments. A transaction reaches this state when a payer is sent away from Swedbank Pay to do a confirmation or verification. Examples of this can be payment apps like Swish, Vipps or MobilePay, or 3-D Secure verifications for card payments. Create Payment To create a Swish payment, you perform an HTTP POST against the /psp/swish/payments resource. An example of a payment creation request is provided below.

When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees. Transactions List The Transaction List (provided in .xlsx and .xml formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment instrument. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for human interaction. The first row contains the name of the Swedbank Pay company (e.g. Swedbank Pay Solutions AB) that the merchant has the contract with, and the balance report number. The header fields contain a summary of the transactions displayed in the body. Header fields Field Type Description Prefix String The Prefix used for transactions, only eligible if merchant uses prefix. Currency ISO 4217 Settlement currency (e.g. SEK, NOK, EUR).

Reconciliation To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system against the information provided by Swedbank Pay in the balance report and transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction. sequenceDiagram participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Merchant activate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Online payment transactions deactivate Merchant deactivate SwedbankPay activate Merchant SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file) note left of Merchant: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file) SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file) deactivate Merchant There are two ways for you to match the information from your system with the information given in the reconciliation files from Swedbank Pay: You can use information generated by your system (you will have to set a unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or You can use the transaction number generated by Swedbank Pay (this is called transaction number and is returned from Swedbank Pay after you have created the transaction). A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the payeeReference. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called OrderID in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"transaction\": { \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 0, \"description\": \"Test Reversal\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\" } } When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include transaction.number.

Samples The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with Swedbank Pay. For some payment instruments, only option A is available, while for other payment instruments, only option B is available. The sample files can be downloaded below. Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Split Settlement The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both your sub merchants and yourself. In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres, sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to charities. What we need from you as a company Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include. We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security for you. Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you send to us. We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system. Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched to the correct merchant in our back office system. A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts and fees. How it works We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems. The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you create the payment for the goods or service. The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment. The payment goes into the client funds account. Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix number. The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant. Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted automatically. Payout to the sub merchant is done. The upsides Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you: Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway. Only need one acquiring agreement. Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate. Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once. Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us to a matter of hours. The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Payment Link The implementation sequence for this scenario is a variant of the purchase sequence. The consumer is not redirected to the Payments directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link, a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for payment instruments listed below, using the Redirect platform and Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. Credit card MobilePay Swish Vipps When the consumer/end-user starts the purchase process in your merchant or webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the consumer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. info When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next section. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If callbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. E-mail And SMS Recommendations When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms &amp; Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Receipt Recommendations We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API Requests The API requests depend on the payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture, cancellation or reversal. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Purchase are listed below. Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered. Options All valid options when posting in a payment with operation Purchase, are described in each payment instrument’s respective API reference. Please see the general sequence diagrams for more information about payments in one-phase (e.g. Swish and credit card with autocapture) and two-phase (e.g. Credit card, MobilePay, Vipps). Authorization When using two-phase flows you reserve the amount with an authorization, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is Authorize. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Capture Capture can only be performed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. If you want the credit card to be charged right away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is AutoCapture. The credit card will be charged and you don’t need to do any more financial operations to this purchase. Cancel Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount. Reversal Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed. General When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Purchase flow The sequence diagrams display the high level process of the purchase, from generating a Payment Link to receiving a Callback. This in a generalized flow as well as a specific 3-D Secure enabled credit card scenario. info Please note that the the callback may come either before, after or in the same moment as the consumer are being redirected to the status page at the merchant site when the purchase is fulfilled. Don’t rely on the callback being timed at any specific moment. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: consumer starts purchase activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase process activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST [payment] (operation=PURCHASE) activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource with payment URL activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: Payment URL sent to order system activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: Distribute Payment URL through e-mail/SMS activate Consumer note left of Consumer: Payment Link in e-mail/SMS Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: Open link and enter payment information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to merchant site activate Consumer note left of SwedbankPay: redirect back to merchant Consumer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET [payment] activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: display purchase result Options after posting a payment If the payment enable a two-phase flow (Authorize), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests. It is possible to “abort” the validity of the Payment Link. See the Abort description here. For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request. When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Description The description field is a 40 character length textual summary of the purchase. It is needed to specify what payer is actually purchasing. Below you will find an abbreviated Card Payments Purchase request. As you can see the description field is set to be test purchase - orderNumber28749347 in the the code example. The images below will show you the payment UI for the Redirect and Seamless View scenario. info Notice that for Redirect, the description will be shown as test purchase - orderNumber28749347, as set in the code example. For the Seamless View scenario, the description is not shown in the payment window, but it is still required in the initial request.

If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl. You will still need to do a GET request on the payment resource to find the final status (Completed or Failed). Payment Url For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting the payment instrument. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer. paymentUrl is used by the Seamless View flow and must be used for WebView-based app implementations. Some payment instruments only work when owning the full browser page (no use of &lt;iframe&gt;), this will be solved by doing a full browser (top frame) redirect out of the Seamless View. 3-D Secure requires this, for example. For mobile flows, some payment instruments work best when app-to-app switching is enabled and handled automatically (Swish, Vipps etc). To solve this, it is important that the third party app or site understand where to redirect the consumer back to after the flow on their end is completed. The paymentUrl is the URL Swedbank Pay will provide to the third party for handling the redirect back to your site or app. When receiving the consumer back on the paymentUrl either in an app or web page it is important to restore the Seamless View to let the payment finalize the flow. For in-app it is important that you either implement the onPaymentCompleted event or let the Seamless View redirect to the completeUrl before intercepting the WebView. If you intercept the WebView when the consumer device is redirected to the paymentUrl it can lead to issues. If you want to handle payment errors in your own code, you should also subscribe to other events provided by the Seamless View JavaScript and shut down the Seamless View if any of these events occur. Events to subscribe to for full control over the payment flow are: Event Description onError Will trigger any time a system error occur from the JavaScript. onPaymentFailed will call registrered endpoint if provided. If not subscribed to will redirect to conpleteUrl onPaymentCanceled will be called if the payment is aborted by the consumer or triggered by you with the Abort command on the payment onPaymentTransactionFailed this will trigger if one payment attempt failed. Standard functionality are to let the consumer be able to retry the payment from the payment page. When implementing the Seamless View flow into a WebView in your mobile app, you should use a custom scheme or Universal Link in the paymentUrl for handling automatic switching between your app and the payment app on the mobile device. Prices The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment.

This is most relevant when using card based payments as each type correspond to a card brand or bank respectively. Swish Payments Type Description Swish Always Swish PayeeInfo The payeeinfo resource contains information about the payee (i.e. a merchant, a corporation etc) related to a specific payment. Request 1 2 3 4 GET /psp/swish/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/payeeInfo HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Content-Type: application/json Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json { \"payment\": \"/psp/swish/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1\", \"payeeInfo\": { \"id\": \"/psp/swish/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/payeeInfo\", \"payeeId\": \"5cabf558-5283-482f-b252-4d58e06f6f3b\" \"payeeReference\": \"EN1234\", \"payeeName\": \"TestMerchant1\", \"productCategory\": \"EF1234\", \"orderReference\": \"or-123456\" } } Field Type Description payment string The relative URI and unique identifier of the payment resource this payeeInfo belongs to..

Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ payeeId string This is the unique id that identifies this payee (like merchant) set by Swedbank Pay └➔ payeeReference string(35) A unique reference set by the merchant system. See below for details └➔ payeeName string The payee name (like merchant name) that will be displayed to consumer when redirected to Swedbank Pay. └➔ productCategory string A product category or number sent in from the payee/merchant. This is not validated by Swedbank Pay, but will be passed through the payment process and may be used in the settlement process. You therefore need to ensure that the value given here is valid in the settlement. └➔ orderReference string(50) The order reference should reflect the order reference found in the merchant’s systems. Payee Reference The payeeReference given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract. It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system. Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the payeeReference is sent to the acquirer. If you select Option A in the settlement process (Swedbank Pay will handle the settlement), Swedbank Pay will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the payeeReference must be in the format of characters A-Za-z0-9 (including -) and string(30). If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), Swedbank Pay will send the payeeReference to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits. Expansion The payment resource contain the ID of related sub-resources in its response properties. These sub-resources can be expanded inline by using the request parameter expand. This is an effective way to limit the number of necessary calls to the API, as you return several properties related to a Payment resource in a single request. info Note that the expand parameter is available to all API requests but only applies to the request response. This means that you can use the expand parameter on a POST or PATCHrequest to get a response containing the target resource including expanded properties. This example below add the urls and authorizations field inlines to the response, enabling you to access information from these sub-resources. Expansion 1 2 GET /psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1?$expand=urls,authorizations HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com To avoid unnecessary overhead, you should only expand the nodes you need info about. Transactions A payment contains sub-resources in the form of transactions. Most operations performed on a payment ends up as a transaction. The different types of operations that alter the state of the payment by creating a transaction is described below. The transactions resource will list the transactions (one or more) on a specific payment. Request 1 2 3 4 GET /psp/swish/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/transactions HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Content-Type: application/json The transaction resource contains information about the transaction transaction made against a swish payment. You can return a specific transaction transaction by performing a GET request towards the specific transaction’s id.

When a transaction is created it will have one of three states: Initialized - if there is some error where the source is undeterminable (network failure, etc), the transaction will remain Initialized. The corresponding state of the payment order will in this case be set to pending. No further transactions can be created. Completed - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to completion. Failed - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment order gets the state failed as well).

Callback When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform a callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ number integer The payment number , useful when there’s need to reference the payment in human communication. Not usable for programmatic identification of the payment, for that id should be used instead. └➔ created string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was created. └➔ updated string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was updated. └➔ state string Ready, Pending, Failed or Aborted. Indicates the state of the payment, not the state of any transactions performed on the payment. To find the state of the payment’s transactions (such as a successful authorization), see the transactions resource or the different specialized type-specific resources such as authorizations or sales. └➔ prices object The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment. └➔ prices.id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the prices resource . Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. └➔ description string(40) A 40 character length textual description of the purchase. └➔ payerReference string The reference to the payer (consumer/end-user) from the merchant system, like e-mail address, mobile number, customer number etc. └➔ userAgent string The user agent string of the consumer’s browser. └➔ language string sv-SE, nb-NO or ee-EE. └➔ urls string The URI to the urls resource where all URIs related to the payment can be retrieved. └➔ payeeInfo string The URI to the payeeinfo resource where the information about the payee of the payment can be retrieved. operations array The array of possible operations to perform └─➔ method string The HTTP method to use when performing the operation. └─➔ href string The target URI to perform the operation against. └─➔ rel string The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource. Operations The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the href and method as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its rel value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the rel and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation. Operation Description update-payment-abort aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. redirect-authorization Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the card authorization UI. view-authorization Contains the JavaScript href that is used to embed the card authorization UI directly on the webshop/merchant site create-capture Creates a capture transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer. create-cancellation Creates a cancellation transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment. paid-payment Returns the information about a payment that has the status paid. failed-payment Returns the information about a payment that has the status failed. Payment States And Transaction States Both payments and transactions can be in several different states during the course of a purchase. You can find a short description of each state below. Payments ready means that the payment has been created successfully, and is now ready for further transaction operations, like authorization, sale or abort. failed means that something went wrong during the payment process, and no further transactions can be created if the payment is in this state. Examples of possible failures are triggering of anti-fraud protection or if the payer reaches the maximum number of attempts for a given payment. aborted means that the merchant has aborted the payment before the end user has fulfilled the payment process. This is done by calling the PATCH function for abort operations. pending is the state of a payment when a transaction is in an initialized state. See more below. As long as a payment is pending, no further transactions can be done. Transactions ìntialized is the transaction state when something unexpected occured, and it is impossible to determine the exact status of the transaction. An example of this can be a network failure. No further actions can be done on a payment with a transaction in this state. completed means that the transaction has reached its intended purpose. An authorization will be completed when the funds have been authorized, a capture will be completed when the funds have been captured and a reversal will be completed when the payer has been refunded. failed means that the transaction has failed. The state is final for that specific transaction, but given that the payment is operational, it is possible to perform more transactions on the same payment, i.e. retry the authorization with another card. If the payer reaches the maximum amount of retries, the payment itself will be set to failed. awaitingActivity is in use for a selection of payment instruments. A transaction reaches this state when a payer is sent away from Swedbank Pay to do a confirmation or verification. Examples of this can be payment apps like Swish, Vipps or MobilePay, or 3-D Secure verifications for card payments. Create Payment Within the card payments part of the eCommerce API, you can create four kinds of payments (purchase, recurrence, payout and verification) and you can inspect and alter the details of the individual transactions within the payment. To create a card payment, you perform an HTTP POST against the payments resource. There are four different kinds of payment that can be created. These are identified with the value of the operation field. Each kind are documented in their own section below.

It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction. An example of a request is provided below. Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below.

CompleteUrl This URL will be used by Swedbank Pay when a payment is Completed or Failed. If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl. You will still need to do a GET request on the payment resource to find the final status (Completed or Failed). Description The description field is a 40 character length textual summary of the purchase. It is needed to specify what payer is actually purchasing. Below you will find an abbreviated Card Payments Purchase request. As you can see the description field is set to be test purchase - orderNumber28749347 in the the code example. The images below will show you the payment UI for the Redirect and Seamless View scenario. info Notice that for Redirect, the description will be shown as test purchase - orderNumber28749347, as set in the code example.

An unscheduled purchase, also called a Merchant Initiated Transaction (MIT), is a payment which uses a paymentToken generated through a previous payment in order to charge the same card at a later time. They are done by the merchant without the cardholder being present. unscheduled purchases differ from recur as they are not meant to be recurring, but occur as singular transactions. Examples of this can be car rental companies charging the payer’s card for toll road expenses after the rental period.

This without  the need to collect card details from the end-user a second time. Introduction Acquirer for this service is Swedbank. You require a separate Swedbank acquiring number to ensure that payout transactions and regular card transactions are kept separate. You need to have the 3-D Secure protocol enabled. The service is available through a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. The current implementation is only available for gaming transactions ( MCC: 7995). The payout service is not a part of Swedbank Pay Settlement Service. API requests The API requests are displayed in the payout flow.  You create a payout by performing a POST creditcard payments with key operation set to payout.

Introduction to Verify This option is commonly used when initiating a subsequent One-click card payment or a recurring card payment flow - where you do not want to charge the consumer right away. info Please note that all boolean credit card attributes involving rejection of certain card types are optional and requires enabling on the contract with Swedbank Pay. Verification through Swedbank Pay Payments When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer initiates a verification operation, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Verify information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a JavaScript source in response. You need to redirect the payer’s browser to that specified URL, or embed the script source on your site to create a Hosted View in an iframe; so that she can enter the credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required. Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer’s browser to - or display directly in the iframe - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a GET request to receive the state of the transaction. Finally you will make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the paymentID received in the first step, which will return the payment result and a paymentToken that can be used for subsequent One-Click Payments and recurring server-to-server based payments. Screenshots You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the credit card information. API Requests The API requests are displayed in the [Verification flow]. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Value Verify are listed below. Please note that not including paymentUrl in the request will generate a redirect-verification operation in the response, meant to be used in the Redirect flow. Adding paymentUrl input will generate the response meant for Seamless View, which does not include the redirect-verification. The request below is the Redirect option.

The links will take you directly to the API description for the specific request. The diagram also shows in high level, the sequence of the process of a complete purchase. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay participant IssuingBank activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;+Merchant: start verification deactivate Payer Merchant-&gt;&gt;+SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments(operation=VERIFY) deactivate Merchant note left of Payer: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;+Merchant: payment resource deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;+Payer: redirect to verification page deactivate Merchant Payer-&gt;&gt;+SwedbankPay: access verification page deactivate Payer note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay&lt;br&gt;(If Redirect scenario) SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;+Payer: display purchase information deactivate SwedbankPay Payer-&gt;&gt;Payer: input creditcard information Payer-&gt;&gt;+SwedbankPay: submit creditcard information deactivate Payer opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;Payer: redirect to IssuingBank deactivate SwedbankPay Payer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Payer-&gt;&gt;+SwedbankPay: access authentication page deactivate Payer end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;+Payer: redirect to merchant deactivate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: redirect back to merchant&lt;br&gt;(If Redirect scenario) Payer-&gt;&gt;+Merchant: access merchant page Merchant-&gt;&gt;+SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; deactivate Merchant note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;+Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant--&gt;&gt;Payer: display purchase result deactivate Merchant opt Callback is set activate SwedbankPay SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Payment is updated SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;Merchant: POST Payment Callback deactivate SwedbankPay end One-Click Payments One-Click Payments utilize a previously generated payment token to prefill payment details for credit card or invoice payments pages - which means that the payer don’t need to enter these details for every purchase. Introduction For credit card and financing invoice payments the payment flow and implementation varies from your default only being the use of a paymentToken. The details in this section describe explicitly the parameters that must be set to enable one-click purchases. Payment Url For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when at the 3-D Secure verification for credit card payments. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer. paymentUrl is used by the Seamless View flow and must be used for WebView-based app implementations. Some payment instruments only work when owning the full browser page (no use of &lt;iframe&gt;), this will be solved by doing a full browser (top frame) redirect out of the Seamless View. 3-D Secure requires this, for example. For mobile flows, some payment instruments work best when app-to-app switching is enabled and handled automatically (Swish, Vipps etc). To solve this, it is important that the third party app or site understand where to redirect the consumer back to after the flow on their end is completed. The paymentUrl is the URL Swedbank Pay will provide to the third party for handling the redirect back to your site or app. When receiving the consumer back on the paymentUrl either in an app or web page it is important to restore the Seamless View to let the payment finalize the flow. For in-app it is important that you either implement the onPaymentCompleted event or let the Seamless View redirect to the completeUrl before intercepting the WebView. If you intercept the WebView when the consumer device is redirected to the paymentUrl it can lead to issues. If you want to handle payment errors in your own code, you should also subscribe to other events provided by the Seamless View JavaScript and shut down the Seamless View if any of these events occur. Events to subscribe to for full control over the payment flow are: Event Description onError Will trigger any time a system error occur from the JavaScript. onPaymentFailed will call registrered endpoint if provided. If not subscribed to will redirect to conpleteUrl onPaymentCanceled will be called if the payment is aborted by the consumer or triggered by you with the Abort command on the payment onPaymentTransactionFailed this will trigger if one payment attempt failed. Standard functionality are to let the consumer be able to retry the payment from the payment page. When implementing the Seamless View flow into a WebView in your mobile app, you should use a custom scheme or Universal Link in the paymentUrl for handling automatic switching between your app and the payment app on the mobile device. API Requests To Generate paymentToken When making the initial purchase request, you need to generate a paymentToken. You can do this either by by setting the generatePaymentToken field to true (see example below) when doing a card purchase, or set the initial operation to Verify. generatePaymentToken field 1 2 3 { \"generatePaymentToken\": true } Finding paymentToken value When the initial purchase is followed through, a paymentToken will linked to the payment. You can return the value by making a GET request towards payment resource (expanding either the authorizations or verifications sub-resource), after the consumer successfully has completed the purchase. The two examples are provided below. Request Towards Authorizations Resource 1 2 3 GET /psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/authorizations HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Request Towards Verifications Resource 1 2 3 GET /psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/verifications HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; You need to store the paymentToken from the response in your system and keep track of the corresponding consumer-ID in your system. Returning Purchases When a known consumer (where you have attained a consumer-ID or similar) returns to your system, you can use the payment token, using already stored payment data, to initiate one-click payments. You will need to make a standard purchase, following the sequence as specified in the Redirect or Seamless View scenarios for credit card and financing invoice. When making the first POST request you insert the paymentToken field. This must be the paymentToken you received in the initial purchase, where you specified the generatePaymentToken to true. See the Other Feature sections for how to create a card and invoice payment. Abbreviated code example: Request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 POST /psp/creditcard/payments HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;AccessToken&gt; Content-Type: application/json { \"payment\": { \"operation\": \"Purchase\", \"intent\": \"Authorization\", \"paymentToken\": \"5a17c24e-d459-4567-bbad-aa0f17a76119\" }, \"creditCard\": { \"noCVC\": true } } Required Field Type Description check payment object The payment object. check └➔ operation string Determines the initial operation, that defines the type card payment created. Purchase. Used to charge a card. It is followed up by a capture or cancel operation. Recur.Used to charge a card on a recurring basis. Is followed up by a capture or cancel operation (if not Autocapture is used, that is). Payout. Used to deposit funds directly to credit card. No more requests are necessary from the merchant side. Verify. Used when authorizing a card withouth reserveing any funds. It is followed up by a verification transaction. check └➔ intent string The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be effectuated. This determine the type transactions used during the payment process. Authorization. Reserves the amount, and is followed by a cancellation or capture of funds. AutoCapture. A one phase-option that enable capture of funds automatically after authorization. check └➔ paymentToken string The paymentToken value received in GET response towards the Payment Resource is the same paymentToken generated in the initial purchase request. The token allow you to use already stored card data to initiate one-click payments.   └➔ creditCard object An object that holds different scenarios for card payments.   └─➔ noCvc boolean true if the CVC field should be disabled for this payment in the case a stored card is used; otherwise false per default. To use this feature it has to be enabled on the contract with Swedbank Pay. info When redirecting to Swedbank Pay the payment page will be prefilled with the payer’s card details. See example below. Delete payment token If you, for any reason, need to delete a paymentToken you use the Delete payment token request. warning Please note that this call does not erase the card number stored at Swedbank Pay. A card number is automatically deleted six months after a successful Deletepayment token request. If you want card information removed at an earlier date, you need to contact ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.dk, verkkokauppa.setup@swedbankpay.fi, ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.no or ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.se; and supply them with the relevant transaction reference or payment token.

Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

The consumer is not redirected to the Payments directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link, a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for payment instruments listed below, using the Redirect platform and Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. Credit card MobilePay Swish Vipps When the consumer/end-user starts the purchase process in your merchant or webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the consumer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. info When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next section. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If callbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. E-mail And SMS Recommendations When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms &amp; Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Receipt Recommendations We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API Requests The API requests depend on the payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture, cancellation or reversal. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Purchase are listed below. Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered. Options All valid options when posting in a payment with operation Purchase, are described in each payment instrument’s respective API reference. Please see the general sequence diagrams for more information about payments in one-phase (e.g. Swish and credit card with autocapture) and two-phase (e.g. Credit card, MobilePay, Vipps). Authorization When using two-phase flows you reserve the amount with an authorization, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is Authorize. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Capture Capture can only be performed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. If you want the credit card to be charged right away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is AutoCapture. The credit card will be charged and you don’t need to do any more financial operations to this purchase. Cancel Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount. Reversal Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed. General When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Purchase flow The sequence diagrams display the high level process of the purchase, from generating a Payment Link to receiving a Callback. This in a generalized flow as well as a specific 3-D Secure enabled credit card scenario. info Please note that the the callback may come either before, after or in the same moment as the consumer are being redirected to the status page at the merchant site when the purchase is fulfilled. Don’t rely on the callback being timed at any specific moment. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: consumer starts purchase activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase process activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST [payment] (operation=PURCHASE) activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource with payment URL activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: Payment URL sent to order system activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: Distribute Payment URL through e-mail/SMS activate Consumer note left of Consumer: Payment Link in e-mail/SMS Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: Open link and enter payment information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to merchant site activate Consumer note left of SwedbankPay: redirect back to merchant Consumer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET [payment] activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: display purchase result Options after posting a payment If the payment enable a two-phase flow (Authorize), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests. It is possible to “abort” the validity of the Payment Link. See the Abort description here. For reversals, you will need to implement the Reversal request. When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Create authorization transaction The direct-authorization operation creates an authorization transaction directly whilst the redirect-authorization operation redirects the consumer to a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page, where the payment is authorized by the consumer. warning PCI-DSS Complicance In order to use the direct-authorization operation, you need to collect card data on your website, which means it must be PCI-DSS Compliant.

Payee Reference The payeeReference given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract. It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system. Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the payeeReference is sent to the acquirer. If you select Option A in the settlement process (Swedbank Pay will handle the settlement), Swedbank Pay will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the payeeReference must be in the format of characters A-Za-z0-9 (including -) and string(30). If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), Swedbank Pay will send the payeeReference to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits.

When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees. Transactions List The Transaction List (provided in .xlsx and .xml formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment instrument.

A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the payeeReference. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called OrderID in the reconciliation file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"transaction\": { \"amount\": 1500, \"vatAmount\": 0, \"description\": \"Test Reversal\", \"payeeReference\": \"ABC123\" } } When you receive the response from Swedbank Pay, the response will include transaction.number.

Samples The content of the files depends on the type of agreement you have made with Swedbank Pay.

Option A: Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process PDF Balance Report for Swedbank Pay Checkout PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Option B: You will handle the settlement process yourself PDF Balance Report XLSX Transaction List XML Transaction List Split Settlement The prefix split is the easy way of doing settlements for companies with multiple sub merchants. With only a few easy steps, you can make the settlement process more efficient with regards to invoicing, payouts and setup for both your sub merchants and yourself. In short, it is a settlement feature where a company with a website or an app can attach specific prefix numbers to sub merchants selling their goods or services through the company. The prefix number is used to match the transactions and the merchant, so the settlement is automatically split between the sub merchants. If you run a site selling tickets to concerts, theatres, sporting events etc., each venue gets its own prefix number. If you run a funeral home, the sub merchants can be everything from flower delivery to charities. What we need from you as a company Send us a KYC form for each sub merchant you want to include. We will also do a KYC check on your sub merchants, providing extra security for you. Give every sub merchant who sells goods/services at your website or in your app a unique prefix number. This needs to be included in the KYC form you send to us. We recommend using the same customer number they have in your system. Attach the prefix number to all the goods/services the sub merchant sells through your website or app, so the goods/services can be matched to the correct merchant in our back office system. A partner agreement is needed for the automatic deduction of revenue cuts and fees. How it works We set up the sub merchant prefix in our systems. The prefix number is added in the subsite field in the API call when you create the payment for the goods or service. The customer selects payment instrument and completes the payment. The payment goes into the client funds account. Swedbank Pay matches the transaction and the merchant using the prefix number. The settlement is split and connected to the correct merchant. Revenue cuts for the super merchant and fees from Swedbank Pay are deducted automatically. Payout to the sub merchant is done. The upsides Since the sub merchants are connected to Swedbank Pay through the super merchant instead of having separate setups, this means that you: Only need one agreement for credit card, Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, invoice and payment gateway. Only need one acquiring agreement. Only need one Vipps/Swish certificate. Can add more payment instruments easily, as it only has to be done once. Can set up new sub merchants quickly, as the only thing needed is a KYC form and a prefix number. This shortens the setup time for both you and us to a matter of hours. The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Problems When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a problem message. We generally use the problem message type and status code to identify the nature of the problem. The problem name and description will often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.

    "text": "Settlement and Reconciliation Reconciliation is an important step in an economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled, captured amounts for the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement. The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using Swedbank Pay. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact omni.client@swedbankpay.se for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice. Settlement There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself : Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process on your behalf, (called “Redovisningsservice”). Swedbank Pay transfers the net amount to you directly. Swedbank Pay Checkout When choosing Swedbank Pay Checkout we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient. You handle the settlement process yourself If you will handle the settlement yourself, then Swedbank Pay will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you. Balance Report The Balance Report (a .pdf file) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees. Payment Summary Provides a summary of the Amount sold, Fees and VAT. If Swedbank Pay handles the settlement process, the Transferedamount - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees). Sales specification Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble if Swedbank Pay handles the Settlement process. Fees specification Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (CreditCard, Invoice) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify Quantity (sales), Amount (sales), Unit price, Provision and fee Amount. If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees.

The automatic settlement split and deduction of fees and revenue cuts minimizes the work for your accounting department, as you do not have to invoice your sub merchants. The prefix split is available with all the payment instruments we offer on our eCom platform. Good to know With regards to admin functions, we offer a full integration towards our admin system. This way, you do not have to log in to Swedbank Pay Admin to perform these operations. Captures and cancels Captures and cancels are done by the super merchant the same way as any other normal flow. Reversals In cases where you need to do reversals, this will be performed by the super merchant. The reversal amount will be charged from the sub merchants prefix. If the sub merchants balance is 0 (zero), the super merchant will be invoiced. The super merchant will in turn have to invoice this amount to the sub merchant. Payment Link The implementation sequence for this scenario is a variant of the purchase sequence. The consumer is not redirected to the Payments directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link, a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for payment instruments listed below, using the Redirect platform and Swedbank Pay hosted payment page. Credit card MobilePay Swish Vipps When the consumer/end-user starts the purchase process in your merchant or webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the consumer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. info When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next section. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If callbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the id of the payment received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. E-mail And SMS Recommendations When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms &amp; Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Receipt Recommendations We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API Requests The API requests depend on the payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture, cancellation or reversal. The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Purchase are listed below. Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered. Options All valid options when posting in a payment with operation Purchase, are described in each payment instrument’s respective API reference. Please see the general sequence diagrams for more information about payments in one-phase (e.g. Swish and credit card with autocapture) and two-phase (e.g. Credit card, MobilePay, Vipps). Authorization When using two-phase flows you reserve the amount with an authorization, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is Authorize. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will later (i.e. when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a Capture or Cancel request. Capture Capture can only be performed on a payment with a successfully authorized transaction. It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount. If you want the credit card to be charged right away, you will have to specify that the intent of the purchase is AutoCapture. The credit card will be charged and you don’t need to do any more financial operations to this purchase. Cancel Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction. If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference between the captured amount and the authorized amount. Reversal Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount not yet reversed. General When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Purchase flow The sequence diagrams display the high level process of the purchase, from generating a Payment Link to receiving a Callback. This in a generalized flow as well as a specific 3-D Secure enabled credit card scenario. info Please note that the the callback may come either before, after or in the same moment as the consumer are being redirected to the status page at the merchant site when the purchase is fulfilled. Don’t rely on the callback being timed at any specific moment. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. sequenceDiagram activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: consumer starts purchase activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase process activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST [payment] (operation=PURCHASE) activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource with payment URL activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-MerchantOrderSystem: Payment URL sent to order system activate MerchantOrderSystem MerchantOrderSystem--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: Distribute Payment URL through e-mail/SMS activate Consumer note left of Consumer: Payment Link in e-mail/SMS Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: Open link and enter payment information activate SwedbankPay opt Card supports 3-D Secure SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Consumer Consumer-&gt;&gt;IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process Consumer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: redirect to merchant site activate Consumer note left of SwedbankPay: redirect back to merchant Consumer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: access merchant page activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET [payment] activate SwedbankPay note left of Merchant: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: payment resource activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Consumer: display purchase result Options after posting a payment If the payment enable a two-phase flow (Authorize), you will need to implement the Capture and Cancel requests.

When implementing the Payment Link scenario, it is optional to set a callbackURL in the POST request. If callbackURL is set Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer as fulfilled the payment. See the Callback API description here. Payment Resource The payment resource is central to all payment instruments. All operations that target the payment resource directly produce a response similar to the example seen below. The response given contains all operations that are possible to perform in the current state of the payment.

Not usable for programmatic identification of the payment, for that id should be used instead. └➔ created string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was created. └➔ updated string The ISO-8601 date of when the payment was updated. └➔ state string Ready, Pending, Failed or Aborted. Indicates the state of the payment, not the state of any transactions performed on the payment. To find the state of the payment’s transactions (such as a successful authorization), see the transactions resource or the different specialized type-specific resources such as authorizations or sales. └➔ prices object The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment. └➔ prices.id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the prices resource .

Operations The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the href and method as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its rel value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the rel and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation. Operation Description update-payment-abort aborts the payment order before any financial transactions are performed. redirect-authorization Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the card authorization UI. view-authorization Contains the JavaScript href that is used to embed the card authorization UI directly on the webshop/merchant site create-capture Creates a capture transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer. create-cancellation Creates a cancellation transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment. paid-payment Returns the information about a payment that has the status paid. failed-payment Returns the information about a payment that has the status failed. Payment States And Transaction States Both payments and transactions can be in several different states during the course of a purchase. You can find a short description of each state below. Payments ready means that the payment has been created successfully, and is now ready for further transaction operations, like authorization, sale or abort. failed means that something went wrong during the payment process, and no further transactions can be created if the payment is in this state. Examples of possible failures are triggering of anti-fraud protection or if the payer reaches the maximum number of attempts for a given payment. aborted means that the merchant has aborted the payment before the end user has fulfilled the payment process. This is done by calling the PATCH function for abort operations. pending is the state of a payment when a transaction is in an initialized state. See more below. As long as a payment is pending, no further transactions can be done. Transactions ìntialized is the transaction state when something unexpected occured, and it is impossible to determine the exact status of the transaction. An example of this can be a network failure. No further actions can be done on a payment with a transaction in this state. completed means that the transaction has reached its intended purpose. An authorization will be completed when the funds have been authorized, a capture will be completed when the funds have been captured and a reversal will be completed when the payer has been refunded. failed means that the transaction has failed. The state is final for that specific transaction, but given that the payment is operational, it is possible to perform more transactions on the same payment, i.e. retry the authorization with another card. If the payer reaches the maximum amount of retries, the payment itself will be set to failed. awaitingActivity is in use for a selection of payment instruments. A transaction reaches this state when a payer is sent away from Swedbank Pay to do a confirmation or verification. Examples of this can be payment apps like Swish, Vipps or MobilePay, or 3-D Secure verifications for card payments. Create Payment To create a Vipps payment, you perform an HTTP POST against the /psp/vipps/payments resource. An example of a payment creation request is provided below. Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section. Use the expand request parameter to get a response that includes one or more expanded sub-resources inlined.

Request 1 2 3 4 5 { \"payment\": { \"operation\": \"Purchase\" } } CompleteUrl This URL will be used by Swedbank Pay when a payment is Completed or Failed. If your integration subscribes to the onPaymentCompleted and possibly the onPaymentFailed event, no redirect or use of the completeUrl will take place. But if you do not have any event handler for the onPaymentCompleted event, the Swedbank Pay JavaScript will perform an HTTP redirect in the top frame to the completeUrl. You will still need to do a GET request on the payment resource to find the final status (Completed or Failed). Payment Url For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting the payment instrument. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer. paymentUrl is used by the Seamless View flow and must be used for WebView-based app implementations. Some payment instruments only work when owning the full browser page (no use of &lt;iframe&gt;), this will be solved by doing a full browser (top frame) redirect out of the Seamless View. 3-D Secure requires this, for example. For mobile flows, some payment instruments work best when app-to-app switching is enabled and handled automatically (Swish, Vipps etc). To solve this, it is important that the third party app or site understand where to redirect the consumer back to after the flow on their end is completed. The paymentUrl is the URL Swedbank Pay will provide to the third party for handling the redirect back to your site or app. When receiving the consumer back on the paymentUrl either in an app or web page it is important to restore the Seamless View to let the payment finalize the flow. For in-app it is important that you either implement the onPaymentCompleted event or let the Seamless View redirect to the completeUrl before intercepting the WebView. If you intercept the WebView when the consumer device is redirected to the paymentUrl it can lead to issues. If you want to handle payment errors in your own code, you should also subscribe to other events provided by the Seamless View JavaScript and shut down the Seamless View if any of these events occur. Events to subscribe to for full control over the payment flow are: Event Description onError Will trigger any time a system error occur from the JavaScript. onPaymentFailed will call registrered endpoint if provided. If not subscribed to will redirect to conpleteUrl onPaymentCanceled will be called if the payment is aborted by the consumer or triggered by you with the Abort command on the payment onPaymentTransactionFailed this will trigger if one payment attempt failed. Standard functionality are to let the consumer be able to retry the payment from the payment page. When implementing the Seamless View flow into a WebView in your mobile app, you should use a custom scheme or Universal Link in the paymentUrl for handling automatic switching between your app and the payment app on the mobile device. Prices The prices resource lists the prices related to a specific payment.

You therefore need to ensure that the value given here is valid in the settlement. └➔ orderReference string(50) The order reference should reflect the order reference found in the merchant’s systems. Payee Reference The payeeReference given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract. It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system. Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the payeeReference is sent to the acquirer. If you select Option A in the settlement process (Swedbank Pay will handle the settlement), Swedbank Pay will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the payeeReference must be in the format of characters A-Za-z0-9 (including -) and string(30). If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), Swedbank Pay will send the payeeReference to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits.

Transactions A payment contains sub-resources in the form of transactions. Most operations performed on a payment ends up as a transaction. The different types of operations that alter the state of the payment by creating a transaction is described below. The transactions resource will list the transactions (one or more) on a specific payment.

The corresponding state of the payment order will in this case be set to pending. No further transactions can be created. Completed - if everything went ok the transaction will follow through to completion. Failed - if the transaction has failed (i.e. a denial from the acquiring bank) it is possible to retry (i.e the consumer tries using another credit card) up to a maximum amount of retries (in that case which the payment order gets the state failed as well).

Callback When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform a callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

    "title": "Payment Link",
    "text": "The implementation sequence for this scenario is a variant of the purchase sequence in a Hosted Payment Pages redirect scenario. The consumer is not redirected to the payment pages directly but will instead receive a payment link via mail/SMS. When the consumer clicks on the link a payment window opens. Introduction The Payment Link can be implemented for Card, MobilePay, Vipps and Swish payments, using the Redirect platform and seamless view. When the consumer starts the purchase process in your merchant/webshop site, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your purchase information. You receive a Payment Link (same as redirect URL) in response. You have to distribute the Payment Link to the customer through your order system, using channels like e-mail or SMS. NOTE: When sending information in e-mail/SMS, it is strongly recommended that you add information about your terms and conditions, including purchase information and price. See recommendations in the next paragraph. When the consumer clicks on the Payment Link, the Swedbank Pay payment page will open, letting the consumer enter the payment details (varying depending on payment instrument) in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. When paying with credit card and if required, Swedbank Pay will handle 3D-secure verification. After completion, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. If CallbackURL is set the merchant system will receive a callback from Swedbank Pay, enabling you to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the paymentID received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. Recommendations regarding Payment Link in E-mail/SMS When you as a merchant sends an e-mail or SMS to the consumer about the Payment Link, it is recommended to include contextual information that help the consumer understand what will happen when clicking on the Payment Link. We recommend that you include following information: The name of the merchant/shop that initiates the payment An understandable product description, describing what kind of service the consumer will pay for. Some order-id (or similar) that exists in the merchant order system. The price and currency. Details about shipping method and expected delivery (if physical goods will be sent to the consumer). Directions to (a link to a page) the merchant’s terms and conditions (such as return policy) and information of how the consumer can contact the merchant. Details informing the consumer that he or she accepts the Terms&amp;Conditions when clicking on the Payment Link. Recommendations about receipts We recommend that you send an e-mail or SMS confirmation with a receipt to the consumer when the payment has been fulfilled. API requests The API-requests depend on which payment instrument you are using when implementing the Payment Link scenario, see purchase flow. One-phase payment instruments will not implement capture or cancellation. The options available when creating a payment with operation set to Purchase are listed below. The general REST based API model is described WHEREEEEE? Screenshots When clicking the payment link, the consumer will be directed to a payment page, similar to the examples below, where payment information can be entered.",

    "text": "Payment Menu begins where Checkin left off, letting the payer complete their purchase. Step 3: Create Payment Order Once consumer has been identified, the next step is to initiate the payment using consumerProfileRef retrieved in the previous step. We start by performing a POST request towards the paymentorder resource with the payer information (such as consumerProfileRef) we obtained in the checkin process described above. Remember to read up on our URL resource. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below. Payment Url For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting the payment instrument Vipps or in the 3-D Secure verification for Credit Card Payments. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Order Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment Order as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer.

Response The response back should look something like this (abbreviated for brevity): Response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 HTTP/1.1 201 Created Content-Type: application/json { \"paymentorder\": { \"id\": \"/psp/paymentorders/09ccd29a-7c4f-4752-9396-12100cbfecce\" }, \"operations\": [ { \"href\": \"https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/paymentmenu/core/scripts/client/px.paymentmenu.client.js?token=5a17c24e-d459-4567-bbad-aa0f17a76119&amp;culture=sv-SE\", \"rel\": \"view-paymentorder\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"contentType\": \"application/javascript\" } ] } Field Type Description paymentorder object The payment order object. └➔ id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the paymentorder resource . Please read about URI Usage to understand how this and other URIs should be used in your solution. operations array The array of possible operations to perform, given the state of the payment order. The paymentorder object is abbreviated since it’s just the id and operations we are interested in. Store the id of the Payment Order in your system to look up status on the completed payment later. Then find the view-paymentorder operation and embed its href in a &lt;script&gt; element. That script will then load the Seamless View for the Payment Menu. We will look into how to hook that up next. info orderReference must be sent as a part of the POST request to paymentorders and must represent the order ID of the webshop or merchant website. Step 4: Display the Payment Menu To load the payment menu from the JavaScript URL obtained in the back end API response, it needs to be set as a script element’s src attribute. You can cause a page reload and do this with static HTML or you can avoid the page refresh by invoking the POST to create the payment order through Ajax and then create the script element with JavaScript, all inside the event handler for onConsumerIdentified. The HTML code will be unchanged in this example.

It should look like this, depending on whether the payer is logged in (top) or a guest user (bottom): When the consumer completes the payment, the Payment Menu script will be signaled and a full redirect to the completeUrl sent in with the Payment Order will be performed. When the completeUrl on your server is hit, you can inspect the status on the stored paymentorder.id on the server, and then perform capture. If the payment is a Sale or one-phase purchase, it will be automatically captured. A third scenario is if the goods are sent physically to the payer; then you should await capture until after the goods have been sent. You may open and close the payment menu using .open() and .close() functions. You can also invoke .refresh() to update the Payment Menu after any changes to the order. Below, you will see a complete overview of the payment menu process. Notice that there are two ways of performing the payment: Consumer perform payment out of iframe. Consumer perform payment within iframe. sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay rect rgba(138, 205, 195, 0.1) activate Payer note left of Payer: Payment Menu Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Initiate Purchase deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: POST /psp/paymentorders (paymentUrl, payer) deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel:view-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Display Payment Menu on Merchant Page activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer --&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Do payment logic deactivate SwedbankPay opt Consumer perform payment out of iFrame Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Redirect to 3rd party Payer -&gt;&gt;+ 3rdParty: Redirect to 3rdPartyUrl URL deactivate Payer 3rdParty --&gt;&gt;+ Payer: Redirect back to paymentUrl (merchant) deactivate 3rdParty Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Initiate Payment Menu Hosted View (open iframe) Payer -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: Show Payment UI page in iframe deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt; Payer: Do payment logic end SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Payer: Payment status deactivate SwedbankPay alt If payment is completed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: onPaymentCompleted Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET &lt;paymentorder.id&gt; deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if paid-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: paid-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end opt If payment is failed activate Payer Payer -&gt;&gt; Payer: Event: OnPaymentFailed Payer -&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: Check payment status deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET {paymentorder.id} deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt;+ Merchant: rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate SwedbankPay opt Get PaymentOrder Details (if failed-paymentorder operation exist) activate Payer deactivate Payer Merchant -&gt;&gt;+ SwedbankPay: GET rel: failed-paymentorder deactivate Merchant SwedbankPay --&gt;&gt; Merchant: Payment Details deactivate SwedbankPay end end activate Merchant Merchant --&gt;&gt;- Payer: Show Purchase complete opt PaymentOrder Callback (if callbackUrls is set) activate Payer deactivate Payer SwedbankPay -&gt;&gt; Merchant: POST Payment Callback end end Now that you have completed the Payment Menu integration, you can move on to finalizing the payment in the After Payment section.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Card Payments – Redirect",
    "text": "Redirect is the simplest integration that lets Swedbank Pay handle the payments, while you handle your core activities. When ready to pay, the consumer will be redirected to a secure Swedbank Pay hosted site. Finally, the consumer will be redirected back to your website after the payment process. When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay payment page. Step 1: Create a Purchase A Purchase payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer. It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction. An example of an abbreviated POST request is provided below. Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below.

When you receive the redirect url from Swedbank Pay, you redirect the payer there to complete the payment. This ensures that card details and other personal information is entered in a secure environment. Swedbank Pay handles all authentication during this phase. After an attempted payment, Swedbank Pay will redirect the Payer to one of two specified URLs: completeUrl or cancelUrl. If the payer cancel at any point during payment, he or she will reach the cancelUrl. If the payment session is followed through completely, the payer will reach the completeUrl. info Important: Both successful and rejected payments are labeled as completed. This means that when you reach this point, you need to make sure that the payment has gone through before you let the payer know that the payment was successful. You do this by doing a GET request. This request has to include the payment Id generated from the initial POST request, so that you can receive the state of the transaction. If you have chosen Seamless View, the completeUrl and cancelUrl will display directly inside the iframe. This is how the payment window might look like: Purchase flow sequenceDiagram participant Payer participant Merchant participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: start purchase activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: POST /psp/creditcard/payments activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: First API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization ① activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: authorization page activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authorization page activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: redirect to SwedbankPay ② SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase information activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;Payer: input creditcard information ③ Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: submit creditcard information opt Card supports 3-D Secure note left of Payer: Authentication Challenge ④ SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;Payer: redirect to IssuingBank activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-IssuingBank: 3-D Secure authentication process activate IssuingBank IssuingBank-&gt;&gt;-Payer: 3-D Secure authentication process activate Payer Payer-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: access authentication page activate SwedbankPay end SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Payer: CompleteUrl ⑤ activate Merchant Merchant-&gt;&gt;-SwedbankPay: GET &lt;payment.id&gt; ⑥ activate SwedbankPay note left of Payer: Second API request SwedbankPay--&gt;&gt;-Merchant: rel: redirect-authorization activate Merchant Merchant--&gt;&gt;-Payer: display purchase result opt Callback is set activate SwedbankPay SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;SwedbankPay: Payment is updated SwedbankPay-&gt;&gt;-Merchant: POST Payment Callback end Explanations ① rel: redirect-authorization is the name of one of the operations, sent as a response from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant. The href in this operation is the redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay payment page. ② The consumer is being redirected to a secure Swedbank Pay hosted page ③ The payment window is presented and the consumer can insert card information for authorization. ④ If needed the consumer must go through an authorization challenge to verify the identity. ⑤ The Payer reaches the CompleteUrl which you defined in the initial POST request. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. ⑥ Send a GET request with the paymentId to check the state of the transaction. Click the link for a complete list of payment and transaction states. 3-D Secure info No 3-D Secure and card acceptance: There are optional parameters that can be used in relation to 3-D Secure and card acceptance. By default, most credit card agreements with an acquirer will require that you use 3-D Secure for card holder authentication. However, if your agreement allows you to make a card payment without this authentication, or that specific cards can be declined, you may adjust these optional parameters when posting in the payment. This is specified in the technical reference section for creating credit card payments – you will find the link in the sequence diagram below. Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required. When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are two alternative outcomes of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. Back: Introduction Next: Seamless View",

    "title": "Swedbank Pay MobilePay Online Payments – Redirect",
    "text": "MobilePay Online Payments is a two-phase payment instrument which can be implemented by the supported redirect scenario. Swedbank Pay receives the MobilePay details from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. The payment will then be performed by Swedbank Pay and confirmed by the payer through the MobilePay app. MobilePay redirect integration flow When you have prepared your merchant/webshop site, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. You will receive a Redirect URL, leading to a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment, in response. You need to redirect the browser of the end-user/consumer to that URL so that the user may enter their MobilePay details. When the payment is completed, Swedbank Pay will redirect the browser back to your merchant/webshop site. Finally you need to make a GET request towards Swedbank Pay with the paymentID received in the first step, which will return the purchase result. link Defining callbackUrl: When implementing a scenario, it is strongly recommended to set a callbackUrl in the POST request. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Step 1: Create a Purchase When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information. This will generate a payment with a unique id. See the POSTrequest example below.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Vipps Redirect",
    "text": "Vipps Payments is a two-phase payment instrument supported by the major Norwegian banks. In the redirect scenario, Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (msisdn) from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment that the payer must confirm through the Vipps mobile app. Introduction When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page. You need to redirect the payer to the Redirect payment where the payer must push the payment button. This triggers a POST towards Swedbank Pay. The payer is redirected to a Vipps payment page where he or she is prompted to enter their mobile number. Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Vipps and the consumer confirms the purchase in the Vipps app. To receive the state of the transaction you need to do a GET request containing the paymentID generated in the first step. You redirect the payer to collect the payer’s mobile number. Step 1: Create a Purchase link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. A Purchase payment is a straightforward way to charge the the payer. Below you will see the POST request you will need to send to collect the purchase information.

This does not indicate a successful payment, only that it has reached a final (complete) state. A GET request needs to be performed on the payment to inspect it further.   └─➔ cancelUrl string The URI to redirect the payer to if the payment is canceled. Only used in redirect scenarios. Can not be used simultaneously with paymentUrl; only cancelUrl or paymentUrl can be used, not both.   └─➔ callbackUrl string The URL that Swedbank Pay will perform an HTTP POST against every time a transaction is created on the payment. See [callback][callback] for details. check └➔ payeeInfo object The payeeInfo contains information about the payee. check └─➔ payeeId string This is the unique id that identifies this payee (like merchant) set by Swedbank Pay. check └─➔ payeeReference string(50*) A unique reference from the merchant system.

Step 2: Authorization To create an authorization in the redirect flow, simply perform an HTTP redirect of the payer towards the URL in the href of the redirect-authorization operation found in the list of operations in the response from the creation of the payment. Once the payment is successfully authorized by the payer, she is returned to completeUrl or cancelUrl depending on the action performed by the payer. On that page as well as in the callbackUrl, you need to perform an HTTP GET request towards the id of the payment to inspect its status. Step 3: Get the transaction state The GETrequest below will give you the transaction state of the payment. The paymentId used below was provided in the fist step when creating a purchase.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Invoice Redirect",
    "text": "Introduction When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay payment page. You need to redirect the payer’s browser to that specified URL so that the payer can enter the credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay environment. Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer’s browser to - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a GET request to receive the state of the transaction, containing the paymentID generated in the first step, to receive the state of the transaction. Step 1: Create a payment An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an Authorize transaction, that is followed by a Capture or Cancel request. link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. To initiate the payment process, you need to make a POST request to Swedbank Pay. Our payment example below uses the FinancingConsumer value. All valid options when posting a payment with operation equal to FinancingConsumer, are described in other features.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Swish Redirect",
    "text": "Swish is a one-phase payment instrument supported by the major Swedish banks. Swish Payments Redirect is where Swedbank Pay performs a payment that the payer confirms in the Swish mobile app. The consumer initiates the payment by supplying the Swish registered mobile number (msisdn), connected to the Swish app. Introduction When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a JavaScript source in response. You need to redirect the payer to the payment page where she is prompted to enter the Swish registered mobile number. This triggers the initiation of a sales transaction. Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Swish and the consumer confirms the purchase in the Swish app. Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer’s browser to - or display directly in the iFrame - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. The consumer/end-user is redirected to Swedbank Pay hosted pages and prompted to insert her phone number to initiate the sales transaction. Swish is a one-phase payment instrument that is based on sales transactions not involving capture or cancellation operations. link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment.

December 2019 Update in checkin module We have added support for specifying language as input in checkin module, language. Supported languages are Norwegian, Swedish and English. Consumers outside Sweden and Norway can now purchase in our Checkout service. You can specify supported countries for shipment in a new input parameter, shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes, in our checkin module. Updated API specification can be found here. The parameters language and shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes have replaced the former consumerCountryCode. The parameters msisdn and email have been made obsolete due to GDPR rules. This information cannot be sent in without an explicit consent from the consumer. November 2019 Welcome, Swedbank Pay Developer Portal PayEx’ Commerce offerings are being rebranded to Swedbank Pay and as a result of that rebranding, PayEx Checkout is now known as Swedbank Pay Checkout and its documentation can be found on here. Support international phone numbers in Swish We have added support for sending in international phone numbers in the request. Check our Swish documentation here. This is supported in API, and when consumer enters their phone number on the payment page. Order Items The input parameter quantity in OrderItems-node is now updated to decimal. You may send up to 4 decimals. See updated documentation here October 2019 Payment Url Credit Card We have added the URL field called paymentUrl for Card Seamless View (previously added for Vipps and Checkout), that will be used when the user is returned from 3rd party. The URL should represent the page in where the payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the hosted payment view was added, in order to initiate the payment. Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. When the JavaScript is invoked after return of the consumer, the consumer will either be redirected to the completeUrl (event onPaymentCompleted) or if payment has failed, see an error-message and get the option to retry the payment. August 2019 Order Items On Payment Orders, itemDescriptions and vatSummary has been replaced with the more versatile and powerful orderItems. While itemDescriptions will continue to work, it is recommended that all integrations switch over to orderItems as soon as possible. When orderItems is used, itemDescriptions must be removed from all requests as the two cannot be used simultaneously. Payment Url For our Seamless Views (currently Vipps or in Checkout), we have added a new URL field called paymentUrl that will be used when user is returned from 3rd party. The URL should represent the page of where the payment hosted view was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the hosted payment view was added to in order to initiate the payment. Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment or Payment Order as the one that initiated the payment originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment or Payment Order stored. When the JavaScript is invoked after return of the consumer, the consumer will either be redirected to the completeUrl, or, if payment failed, see an error-message, and get the option to retry the payment. If paymentUrl is not implemented, retry of payments will not be possible in either individual payment instruments such as Vipps or in Checkout. It makes it more tedious to retry payment as the whole process including the creation of the payment or payment order needs to be performed again. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer.",

    "title": "SDKs and Modules",
    "text": "We have multiple Open Source-based SDKs and Modules to use with Swedbank Pay APIs. Introduction Swedbank Pay offers APIs, SDKs, libraries, modules, extensions and plugins as different ways to integrate and use our products and services. It might not be obvious to everyone what these are, so to describe them we use the analogy of baking a cake. APIs APIs (Application Programming Interface) are the lowest level building block of our offering and can be compared to raw ingredients. They give you a whole lot of flexibility, but also requires you to have more knowledge in how to use them correctly and you need to know which recipe to cook in order to get a workable cake out in the other end. To efficiently use an API, you need to be a trained baker. SDKs SDKs (Software Development Kit), also known as libraries, can be compared to a cake mix. It requires less knowledge of the ingredients and how to use them and a recipe is provided for you. Because of this, you also have less flexibility because you can’t bake any cake, you can only bake the one the mix is for. You still have to mix everything together, so you need some experience in the kitchen is required, but less than using the “raw” API. Modules Modules, also known as extensions or plugins, can be compared to a readily baked cake purchased at a bakery. You don’t need any baking skills to have one, but you also have very little flexibility in what goes into the cake or how it tastes. Official Modules Modules, extensions and plugins are typically used as a way to extend webshop platforms such as WooCommerce and Magento with functionality that isn’t provided in the core platform. Such functionality may be to allow consumers of your website to pay with a payment provider such as Swedbank Pay. warning Unsupported These Modules are at an early stage of development and are not supported as of yet by Swedbank Pay. They are provided as a convenience to speed up your development, so please feel free to play around. However, if you need support, please wait for a future, stable release.

SDKs are often used as a building block to construct a Module. warning Unsupported These SDKs are at an early stage of development and are not supported as of yet by Swedbank Pay.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Swish Seamless View",
    "text": "The Seamless View scenario gives your customers the opportunity to pay with Swish directly within your webshop. This gives the consumer a frictionless experience as we are handling the payment in the implemented iframe on your page Swish Seamless View integration flow When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information. view-sales is a rel value in one of the operations, sent as a response from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant. Open iframe creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe. Show Consumer UI page in iframe displays the payment window as content inside of the iframe. The consumer can insert mobile information for authorization. Event: OnPaymentComplete is when the payment is complete. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. To get the transaction result, you need to follow up with a GET request using the paymentID received in the first step. If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish dialogue is completed, and you will have to make a GET request to check the payment status. Step 1: Create a Purchase A Purchase payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer. You need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay as shown below to create a purchase. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a JavaScript source in response. For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting Swish as payment instrument. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer.

    "text": "The Seamless View scenario represents the opportunity to implement Invoice directly in your webshop. Introduction Seamless View provides an integration of the payment process directly on your website. This solution offers a smooth shopping experience with Swedbank Pay payment pages seamlessly integrated in an iframe on your website. The costumer does not need to leave your webpage, since we are handling the payment in the iframe on your page. link Callback URL It is mandatory to set a callbackUrl in the POST request creating the payment. If callbackUrl is set, Swedbank Pay will send a POST request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment. Upon receiving this POST request, a subsequent GET request towards the id of the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the transaction. Step 1: Create the payment A FinancingConsumer payment is a straightforward way to invoice a payer. It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction. An example of an abbreviated POST request is provided below. Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the invoice process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your invoice information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a JavaScript source in response.

    "title": "Swedbank Pay Payments Vipps Seamless View",
    "text": "The Seamless View scenario gives your customers the opportunity to pay with Vipps directly within your webshop. In the Seamless View scenario, Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (MSISDN) from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment that the payer must confirm through the Vipps mobile app. Step 1: Create a Purchase When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. An example of an abbreviated POST request is provided below. You will receive a response in which you can find the JavaScript source in the view-payment operation. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. For our Seamless Views, the field called paymentUrl will be used when the consumer is redirected out of the Seamless View (the iframe). The consumer is redirected out of frame when selecting Vipps as payment instrument. The URL should represent the page of where the Payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, paymentUrl should be set to the same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the Seamless View was added to in order to initiate the payment process. info Please note that the paymentUrl must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one that initiated the payment process originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. With paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the integration and the payer. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below.

You will need to embed its href in a &lt;script&gt; element. The script will enable loading the payment page in an iframe in our next step. Step 2: Display the payment window You need to embed the script source on your site to create a hosted-view in an iframe; so that she can enter the required information in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps: Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: &lt;div id=\"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\"&gt;. Create a &lt;script&gt; source within the container. Embed the href value obtained in the POST request in the &lt;script&gt; element. Example: 1 &lt;script id=\"payment-page-script\" src=\"https://ecom.dev.payex.com/vipps/core/ scripts/client/px.vipps.client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; The previous two steps gives this HTML: HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file --&gt; &lt;script src=&lt;YourJavaScriptFileHere&gt;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=\"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\"&gt; &lt;script id=\"payment-page-script\" src=\"https://ecom.dev.payex.com/vipps/core/scripts/client/px.vipps.client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the iframe embedded on your website. JavaScript 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &lt;script language=\"javascript\"&gt; payex.hostedView.vipps({ // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the // iframe component. container: \"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\" }).open(); &lt;/script&gt; This is how the payment might look like: Step 3: Create authorization transaction Use the mobile number from the consumer to create an authorization transaction.

Open iframe creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe. The consumer UI page displays the payment window as content inside of the iframe. The consumer can insert mobile information for authorization. A POST request is sent to the Vipps API with the mobile number for authorization. The response will contain the state of the transaction. It will normally be AwaitingActivity in this phase of the payment, meaning we are awaiting a response from Vipps.

    "text": "The Seamless View purchase scenario represents the opportunity to implement card payments directly in your webshop. Introduction Seamless View provides an integration of the payment process directly on your website. This solution offers a smooth shopping experience with Swedbank Pay payment pages seamlessly integrated in an iframe on your website. The payer does not need to leave your webpage, since we are handling the payment in the iframe on your page. Step 1: Create Payment A Purchase payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer. It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction. An example of an abbreviated POST request is provided below. Each individual field of the JSON document is described in the following section. An example of an expanded POST request is available in the other features section. info To minimize the risk for a challenge request (Strong Customer Authentication – “SCA”) on card payments, it’s recommended that you add as much data as possible to the riskIndicator object in the request below. When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique paymentID. You will receive a JavaScript source in response.

The key information in the response is the view-authorization operation. You will need to embed its href in a &lt;script&gt; element. The script will enable loading the payment page in an iframe in our next step. Step 2: Display the Payment You need to embed the script source on your site to create a hosted-view in an iframe; so that she can enter the credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps: Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: &lt;div id=\"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\"&gt;. Create a &lt;script&gt; source within the container. Embed the href value obtained in the POST request in the &lt;script&gt; element. Example: 1 &lt;script id=\"payment-page-script\" src=\"https://ecom.dev.payex.com/creditcard/core/ scripts/client/px.creditcard.client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; The previous two steps gives this HTML: HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file --&gt; &lt;script src=&lt;YourJavaScriptFileHere&gt;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=\"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\"&gt; &lt;script id=\"payment-page-script\" src=\"https://ecom.dev.payex.com/creditcard/core/scripts/client/px.creditcard.client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the iframe embedded on your website. JavaScript 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &lt;script language=\"javascript\"&gt; payex.hostedView.creditCard({ // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the // iframe component. container: \"swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page\" }).open(); &lt;/script&gt; When a user actively attempts to perform a payment, the onPaymentCreated event is raised with the following event argument object: onPaymentCreated event object 1 2 3 4 { \"id\": \"/psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1\", \"instrument\": \"creditcard\", } Field Type Description id string The relative URI and unique identifier of the payment resource .

By default, most credit card agreements with an acquirer will require that you use 3-D Secure for card holder authentication. However, if your agreement allows you to make a card payment without this authentication, or that specific cards can be declined, you may adjust these optional parameters when posting in the payment. This is specified in the technical reference section for creating credit card payments – you will find the link in the sequence diagram below. Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required. When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is an essential topic. There are two alternative outcome of a credit card payment: 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the cardholder is done. Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID. Explanations ① rel: view-authorization is a value in one of the operations, sent as a response from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant. ② Open iframe creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe. ③ Show Consumer UI page in iframe displays the payment window as content inside of the iframe. The consumer can insert card information for authorization. ④ Event: OnPaymentComplete is when er payment is complete. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment. Redirect Next: Capture",

    "text": "Connection and Protocol All requests towards Swedbank Pay API Platform are made with HTTP/1.1 over a secure a TLS 1.2 (or higher) connection. Older HTTP clients running on older operating systems and frameworks might receive connection errors when connecting to Swedbank Pay’s APIs. This is most likely due to the connection being made from the client with TLS 1.0 or even SSL, which are all insecure and deprecated. If such is the case, ensure that you are able to connect over a TLS 1.2 connection by reading information regarding your programming languages and environments (Java, PHP Curl, PHP Zend, Ruby, Python, Node.js Request). You can inspect Swedbank Pay’s TLS and cipher suite support at SSL Labs. Support for HTTP/2 in our APIs is being investigated. Headers All requests against the API Platform should have a few common headers: HTTP request 1 2 3 4 5 6 POST /some/resource HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Accept: application/problem+json; q=1.0, application/json; q=0.9 Authorization: \"Bearer 123456781234123412341234567890AB\" Session-Id: 779da454399742248f2942bb064c4707 Forwarded: for=82.115.151.177; host=example.com; proto=https Required Header Description check︎ Content-Type The content type of the body of the HTTP request. Usually set to application/json. check︎ Accept The content type accepted by the client. Usually set to application/json and application/problem+json so both regular responses as well as errors can be received properly. check︎ Authorization The OAuth 2 Access Token is generated in Swedbank Pay Admin.   Session-Id A trace identifier used to trace calls through the API Platform (ref RFC 7329). Each request must mint a new GUID/UUID. If no Session-Id is provided, Swedbank Pay will generate one for the request.   Forwarded The IP address of the consumer as well as the host and protocol of the consumer-facing web page. When the header is present, only the for parameter containing the consumer IP address is required, the other parameters are optional. See RFC 7239 for details. URI Usage The base URIs of the API Platform are: Environment Base URL Test https://api.externalintegration.payex.com/ Production https://api.payex.com/ An important part of REST is its use of hypermedia. Instead of having to perform complex state management and hard coding URIs and the availability of different operations in the client, this task is moved to the server. The client simply follows links and performs operations provided by the API, given the current state of the resource. The server controls the state and lets the client know through hypermedia what’s possible in the current state of the resource. To get an introduction to hypermedia, please watch this 20 minute video. warning Don’t build URIs It is very important that only the base URIs of Swedbank Pay’s APIs are stored in your system. All other URIs are returned dynamically in the response. Swedbank Pay cannot guarantee that your implementation will remain working if you store any other URIs in your system. When performing requests, please make sure to use the complete URIs that are returned in the response. Do not attempt to parse or build upon the returned data – you should not put any special significance to the information you might glean from an URI. URIs should be treated as opaque identifiers you can use to retrieve the identified resource – nothing more, nothing less. If you don’t follow this advice, your integration most assuredly will break when Swedbank Pay makes updates in the future. Uniform Responses When a POST or PATCH request is performed, the whole target resource representation is returned in the response, as when performing a GET request on the resource URI. This is an economic approach that limits the number of necessary GET requests. Expansion The payment resource contain the ID of related sub-resources in its response properties. These sub-resources can be expanded inline by using the request parameter expand. This is an effective way to limit the number of necessary calls to the API, as you return several properties related to a Payment resource in a single request. Note that the expand parameter is available to all API requests but only applies to the request response. This means that you can use the expand parameter on a POST or PATCHrequest to get a response containing the target resource including expanded properties. This example below add the urls and authorizations field inlines to the response, enabling you to access information from these sub-resources. HTTP request with expansion 1 2 GET /psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1?$expand=urls,authorizations HTTP/1.1 Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com To avoid unnecessary overhead, you should only expand the nodes you need info about. Data Types Some datatypes, like currency, dates and amounts, are managed in a coherent manner across the entire API Platform. Currency All currencies are expressed according to the ISO 4217 standard, e.g SEK, EUR, NOK. Dates All dates are expressed according to the ISO 8601 standard that combine dates, time and timezone data into a string, e.g. 2018-09-14T13:21:57.6627579Z. Locale When defining locale, we use the combination of language (ISO 639-1) and country codes (ISO 3166), e.g. nb-NO, sv-SE, en-US. Monetary Amounts All monetary amounts are entered in the lowest momentary units of the selected currency. The amount of SEK and NOK are in ören/ører, and EUR is in cents. Another way to put it is that the code amount is expressed as if the true amount is multiplied by 100. True amount Code amount NOK 100.00 10000 SEK 50.00 5000 € 10.00 1000 Operations When a resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have a set of operations that can be performed on it. Which operations that are available in a given state varies depending on payment instrument used, what the access token is authorized to do, etc. A subset of possible operations are described below. Visit the technical reference page of a payment instrument for instrument specific operations. JSON with Operations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 { \"payment\": {}, \"operations\": [ { \"href\": \"http://api.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1\", \"rel\": \"update-payment-abort\", \"method\": \"PATCH\" }, { \"href\": \"https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/creditcard/payments/authorize/5a17c24e-d459-4567-bbad-aa0f17a76119\", \"rel\": \"redirect-authorization\", \"method\": \"GET\" }, { \"href\": \"https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/swish/core/scripts/client/px.swish.client.js?token=5a17c24e-d459-4567-bbad-aa0f17a76119\", \"rel\": \"view-payment\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"contentType\": \"application/javascript\" }, { \"href\": \"https://api.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/creditcard/payments/7e6cdfc3-1276-44e9-9992-7cf4419750e1/captures\", \"rel\": \"create-capture\", \"method\": \"POST\" } ] } Field Description href The target URI to perform the operation against. rel The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource. method The HTTP method to use when performing the operation. The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the href and method as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its rel value. PayeeReference Payee Reference The payeeReference given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract. It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system. Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the payeeReference is sent to the acquirer. If you select Option A in the settlement process (Swedbank Pay will handle the settlement), Swedbank Pay will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the payeeReference must be in the format of characters A-Za-z0-9 (including -) and string(30). If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), Swedbank Pay will send the payeeReference to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits. Read more about the settlement process here. Callback When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform a callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Providing a callbackUrl in POST requests is mandatory. Below we provide three example scenarios of why this is important: If the payer closes the payment window, the merchant will never know what happened to the payment if callbackUrl is not implemented. If the payer stops up in a payment app such as Vipps or Swish, the payer will never come back to the merchant. This means that the merchant won’t know what happened to the payment unless callbackUrl is implemented. If a payer experiences a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirected from Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callbackUrl is what ensures that you receive the information about what happened with the payment. When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update. Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP POST to the callbackUrl that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment. When the callbackUrl receives such a callback, an HTTP GET request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update. The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in seconds from the initial transaction time: 30 seconds 60 seconds 360 seconds 432 seconds 864 seconds 1265 seconds The callback is sent from the following IP address: 82.115.146.1 A callback should return a 200 OK response.

Regardless of why the error occurred, the problem message will follow the same structure as specified in the Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC 7807) specification. The structure of a problem message will look like this: Problem Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \"type\": \"https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/creditcard/inputerror\", \"title\": \"There was an input error\", \"detail\": \"Please correct the errors and retry the request\", \"instance\": \"ec2a9b09-601a-42ae-8e33-a5737e1cf177\", \"status\": 400, \"action\": \"RetryNewData\", \"problems\": [{ \"name\": \"CreditCardParameters.Issuer\", \"description\": \"minimum one issuer must be enabled\" }] } Field Type Description type string The URI that identifies the error type. This is the only field usable for programmatic identification of the type of error! When dereferenced, it might lead you to a human readable description of the error and how it can be recovered from. title string The title contains a human readable description of the error. detail string A detailed, human readable description of the error and how you can recover from it. instance string The identifier of the error instance. This might be of use to Swedbank Pay support personnel in order to find the exact error and the context it occurred in. status integer The HTTP status code that the problem was served with. action string The action indicates how the error can be recovered from. problems array The array of problem detail objects. └➔ name string The name of the field, header, object, entity or likewise that was erroneous. └➔ description string The human readable description of what was wrong with the field, header, object, entity or likewise identified by name. Common Problems All common problem types will have a URI in the format https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/&lt;error-type&gt;. The URI is an identifier that you can hard-code and implement logic around. It is currently not not possible to dereference this URI, although that might be possible in the future. Type Status Description inputerror 400 The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request). forbidden 403 The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking. notfound 404 The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible. systemerror 500 A generic error message. configurationerror 500 A error relating to configuration issues. Payment Instrument Specific Problems Problem types for a specific payment instrument will have a URI in the format https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/&lt;payment-instrument&gt;/&lt;error-type&gt;.

Account Receivable Consumer The AccountReceivableConsumer API is the fundament for Swedbank Pay Invoice Payments service. It is a service where Swedbank Pay helps produce and distribute invoices to consumers/end-users. Authorization The first part of a two-phase transaction where a certain amount is blocked on the payer’s account. The authorized amount is unavailable for the consumer, ensuring that the merchant receive the money during the subsequent capture phase. C Callback If callbackURL is set, a Callback is triggered when a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction. Swedbank Pay performs a callback to inform the payee/merchant about this kind of update. Cancellation Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount. Capture The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. Checkin Checkin is the first part of the Swedbank Pay Checkout flow (prior to displaying the Payment Menu), where the payer is identified by email and mobile phone number. Consumer The person doing the purchase, equivalent to Payer. Consumers The Consumers resource stores information about the consumer/payer of the sold services or goods.
